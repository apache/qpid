# The realm specified by -u is very important, and QPID is the default
# for the broker so we use it here. The realm is important because it
# defaults to the local hostname of the machine running the
# broker. This may not seem to bad at first glance, but it means that
# the sasldb has to be tailored to each machine that would be running
# a broker, and if the machine ever changed its name the
# authentication would stop working until the sasldb was updated. For
# these reasons we always want the broker to specify a realm where its
# users live, and we want the users to exist in that realm as well.
