There are two ways to use perftest: 
- single process:
If none of the -Setup, -Publish, -Subscribe or -Control options are given perftest will run a single-process test.
- multi-process: 
For a  multi-process test first run:
Perftest.exe -Setup <other options>
and wait for it to complete. The remaining process should run concurrently:
Run -Pubs times: Perftest.exe -Publish  <other options>
Run -Subs times: Perftest.exe -Subscribe <other options>
Run once:        Perftest.exe -Control <other options>
Note the <other options> must be identical for all processes.
