/**
 * InVMBrokerDecorator is a test decorator, that is activated when running tests against an in-vm broker only. Its
 * purpose is to automatically create, and close and delete an in-vm broker, during the set-up and tear-down of
 * each test case. This decorator may only be used in conjunction with tests that extend {@link FrameworkBaseCase}.

 *
 * @todo May need to add a more fine grained injection point for the in-vm broker management, as this acts at the
 *       suite level, rather than the individual test level.
 *
 * @todo Management of in-vm brokers for failure testing. Failure test setups may need to set their connection url to
 *       use multiple broker (vm://:1;vm://:2), with fail-over between them. There is round-robin fail-over, but also
 *       retry? A test case using an in-vm broker needs to record which one it is using, so that it can be
 *       killed/restarted.
