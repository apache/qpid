New features, Improvements and Bug fixes
----------------------

A security related problem was addressed. If Base64MD5 passwords are
turned on on the broker and it has been configured to use JMXMP via
the addition of jxmremote_optional.jar to the classpath, it is
possible for an attacker to bypass the authentication on the JMX
management interface due to a bug in password verification.

A new command line management interface was added (qpid-cli)
