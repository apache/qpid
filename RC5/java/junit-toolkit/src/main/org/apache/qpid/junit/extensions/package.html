Basic JUnit is enahanced with test runners to run tests repeatedly, simultaneously in many threads and with increasing
test sizes for asymptotic performance measurements. There are features to measure the time and amount of memory that
tests use as well as to record the asymptotic test size parameters. There are some utilities to write these test
statistics to various file formats too and these can be found in the listeners package.

</p>The main test runner class is TKTestRunner which can be called with command line parameters to specify how tests
should be run.
