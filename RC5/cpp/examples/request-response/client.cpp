/**
 *  client.cpp
 *
 *  This program is one of two programs that illustrate the
 *  request/response pattern.
 *  
 *
 *  client.cpp  (this program) 
 *   
 *     A client application that sends messages to the "amq.direct"
 *     exchange, using the routing key "request" to route messages to
 *     the server.
 *
 *     Each instance of the client creates its own private response
 *     queue, binding it to the "amq.direct" exchange using it's
 *     session identifier as the routing key, and places its session
 *     identifier in the "reply-to" property of each message it sends.
 *
 *
 *  server.cpp
 *
 *     A service that accepts messages from a request queue, converts
 *     their content to upper case, and sends the result to the
 *     original sender.
 *
 *     This program creates a request queue, binds it to "amq.direct"
 *     using the routing key "request", then receives messages from
 *     the request queue. Each incoming message is converted to upper
 *     case, then sent to the "amq.direct" exchange using the
 *     request's reply-to property as the routing key for the
 *     response.
