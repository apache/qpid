What are all these .csx files?

This code is being ported over from the java. Some of the conversion was automated using search/replace/regex under emacs, but that cannot do all of it. The files were saved as .csx files with the 'x' standing for in-cross-over state. They will gradually be copied into .cs files as the conversion is completed and they are able to compile.
