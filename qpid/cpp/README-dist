This README describes how to build Qpid from a source distribution.

== Prerequisites ==

 * Apache Portable Runtime 1.2.2:  http://apr.apache.org
 * boost 1.33.1: http://www.boost.org

Optional: if you want to run the qpid unit tests:
 * CppUnit 1.11.4: http://cppunit.sourceforge.net
   Note: Ensure cppunit-config is in your PATH.
 
If you use yum to install packages you can do:

  # yum install apr apr-devel boost boost-devel cppunit cppunit-devel

== Building ==

If you install boost to a non-standard location then you'll need define CXXFLAGS prior 
to doing ./configure:
    
      export CXXFLAGS=-I${boost_prefix}/include/boost-1_33_1

e.g.  export CXXFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/boost-1.33.1/include/boost-1_33_1

Build and install with:
 # ./configure
 # make all
 # make install

TODO: add boilerplate README for standard autoconf/automake install.
TODO: document special qpid configure options.
 ./bootstrap
