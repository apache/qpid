  <title>Programming in Apache Qpid</title>
  <subtitle>Cross-Platform AMQP Messaging in Java JMS, .NET, C++, and Python</subtitle>

  <chapter>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Apache Qpid is a reliable, asynchronous messaging system that
    supports the AMQP messaging protocol in several common programming
    languages. Qpid is supported on most common platforms.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  On the Java platform, Qpid uses the
	  established <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">Java JMS
	  API</ulink>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  For Python, C++, and .NET, Qpid defines its own messaging API, the
	  <firstterm>Qpid Messaging API</firstterm>, which is
	  conceptually similar in each.
	</para>
	<para>
	  On the .NET platform, Qpid also provides a WCF binding.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Ruby will also use the Qpid Messaging API, which will soon
	  be implemented. (Ruby currently uses an API that is closely
	  tied to the AMQP version).

  <chapter>
    <title>Using the Qpid Messaging API</title>

    <para>The Qpid Messaging API is quite simple, consisting of only a
    handful of core classes.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          A <firstterm>message</firstterm> consists of a standard set
          of fields (e.g. <literal>subject</literal>,
          <literal>reply-to</literal>), an application-defined set of
          properties, and message content (the main body of the
          message).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          A <firstterm>connection</firstterm> represents a network
          connection to a remote endpoint.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          A <firstterm>session</firstterm> provides a sequentially
          ordered context for sending and receiving
          <emphasis>messages</emphasis>. A session is obtained from a
          connection.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
	  A <firstterm>sender</firstterm> sends messages to a target
	  using the <literal>sender.send</literal> method. A sender is
	  obtained from a session for a given target address.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
	  A <firstterm>receiver</firstterm> receives messages from a
	  source using the <literal>receiver.fetch</literal> method.
	  A receiver is obtained from a session for a given source
	  address.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <section id="section-addresses">
      <title>Addresses</title>

      <para>An <firstterm>address</firstterm> is the name of a message
      target or message source.

      <footnote><para>In the programs we have just seen, we used
      <literal>amq.topic</literal> as the default address if none is
      passed in. This is the name of a standard exchange that always
      exists on an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker.</para></footnote>

      The methods that create senders and receivers require an
      address. The details of sending to a particular target or
      receiving from a particular source are then handled by the
      sender or receiver. A different target or source can be used
      simply by using a different address.
      </para>

      <para>An address resolves to a <firstterm>node</firstterm>. The
      Qpid Messaging API recognises two kinds of nodes,
      <firstterm>queues</firstterm> and <firstterm>topics</firstterm>

      <footnote><para>The terms <emphasis>queue</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>topic</emphasis> here were chosen to align with
      their meaning in JMS. These two addressing 'patterns',
      queue and topic, are sometimes refered as point-to-point
      and publish-subscribe. AMQP 0-10 has an exchange type
      called a <emphasis>topic exchange</emphasis>. When the term
      <emphasis>topic</emphasis> occurs alone, it refers to a
      Messaging API topic, not the topic
      exchange.</para></footnote>.

      A queue stores each message until it has been received and
      acknowledged, and only one receiver can receive a given message

      <footnote><para>There are exceptions to this rule; for instance,
      a receiver can use <literal>browse</literal> mode, which leaves
      messages on the queue for other receivers to
      read.</para></footnote>.

      A topic immediately delivers a message to all eligible
      receivers; if there are no eligible receivers, it discards the
      message.  In the AMQP 0-10 implementation of the API,

      <footnote><para>The AMQP 0-10 implementation is the only one
      that currently exists.</para></footnote>

      queues map to AMQP queues, and topics map to AMQP exchanges.

      <footnote><para>In AMQP 0-10, messages are sent to
      exchanges, and read from queues. The Messaging API also
      allows a sender to send messages to a queue; internally,
      Qpid implements this by sending the message to the default
      exchange, with the name of the queue as the routing key. The
      Messaging API also allows a receiver to receive messages
      from a topic; internally, Qpid implements this by setting up
      a private subscription queue for the receiver and binding
      the subscription queue to the exchange that corresponds to
      the topic.</para></footnote>
      </para>

      <para>In the rest of this tutorial, we present many examples
      using two programs that take an address as a command line
      parameter.  <command>spout</command> sends messages to the
      target address, <command>drain</command> receives messages from
      the source address.  The source code is available in C++, Python, and
      .NET C# and can be found in the examples directory for each
      language. These programs can use any address string as a source
      or a destination, and have many command line options to
      configure behavior&mdash;use the <command>-h</command> option
      for documentation on these options.

      <footnote><para>Currently, the C++, Python, and .NET C#
      implementations of <command>drain</command> and
      <command>spout</command> have slightly different
      options. This tutorial uses the C++ implementation. The
      options will be reconciled in the near
      future.</para></footnote>


      The examples in this tutorial also use the
      <command>qpid-config</command> utility to configure AMQP 0-10
      queues and exchanges on a Qpid broker.
      </para>


      <example>
        <title>Queues</title>

        <para>Create a queue with <command>qpid-config</command>, send a message using
	<command>spout</command>, and read it using <command>drain</command>:</para>

        <screen>
	  $ qpid-config add queue hello-world
	  $ ./spout hello-world
	  $ ./drain hello-world

	  Message(properties={spout-id:c877e622-d57b-4df2-bf3e-6014c68da0ea:0}, content='')
        </screen>

        <para>The queue stored the message sent by <command>spout</command> and delivered
        it to <command>drain</command> when requested.</para>

	<para>Once the message has been delivered and and acknowledged
	by <command>drain</command>, it is no longer available on the queue. If we run
	<command>drain</command> one more time, no messages will be retrieved.</para>

        <screen>
	  $ ./drain hello-world
	  $
	</screen>

      </example>

      <example>
	<title>Topics</title>

	<para>This example is similar to the previous example, but it
	uses a topic instead of a queue.</para>

	<para>First, use <command>qpid-config</command> to remove the queue
	and create an exchange with the same name:</para>

        <screen>
	  $ qpid-config del queue hello-world
	  $ qpid-config add exchange topic hello-world
        </screen>

	<para>Now run <command>drain</command> and <command>spout</command> the same way we did in the previous example:</para>

	<screen>
	  $ ./spout hello-world
	  $ ./drain hello-world
	  $
        </screen>

        <para>Topics deliver messages immediately to any interested
        receiver, and do not store messages. Because there were no
        receivers at the time <command>spout</command> sent the
        message, it was simply discarded. When we ran
        <command>drain</command>, there were no messages to
        receive.</para>

	<para>Now let's run <command>drain</command> first, using the
	<literal>-t</literal> option to specify a timeout in seconds.
	While <command>drain</command> is waiting for messages,
	run <command>spout</command> in another window.</para>

        <para><emphasis>First Window:</emphasis></para>

        <screen>
	  $ ./drain -t 30 hello-word
        </screen>


        <para><emphasis>Second Window:</emphasis></para>

        <screen>
	  $ ./spout hello-word
        </screen>

        <para>Once <command>spout</command> has sent a message, return
	to the first window to see the output from
	<command>drain</command>:</para>

        <screen>
	  Message(properties={spout-id:7da2d27d-93e6-4803-8a61-536d87b8d93f:0}, content='')
        </screen>

        <para>You can run <command>drain</command> in several separate
	windows; each creates a subscription for the exchange, and
	each receives all messages sent to the exchange.</para>

      </example>

      <section>
	<title>Address Strings</title>

	<para>So far, our examples have used address strings that
	contain only the name of a node. An <firstterm>address
	string</firstterm> can also contain a
	<firstterm>subject</firstterm> and
	<firstterm>options</firstterm>.</para>

	<para>The syntax for an address string is:</para>

	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	address_string ::=  <address> [ / <subject> ] [ ; <options> ]
	options ::=  { <key> : <value>, ... }
	]]></programlisting>

	<para>Addresses, subjects, and keys are strings.  Values can
	be numbers, strings (with optional single or double quotes),
	maps, or lists. A complete BNF for address strings appears in
	<xref linkend="section-address-string-bnf"/>.</para>


	<para>So far, the address strings in this tutorial have only
	used simple names. The following sections show how to use
	subjects and options.</para>

      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Subjects</title>


	<para>Every message has a property called
	<firstterm>subject</firstterm>, which is analogous to the
	subject on an email message. If no subject is specified, the
	message's subject is null. For convenience, address strings
	also allow a subject. If a sender's address contains a
	subject, it is used as the default subject for the messages
	it sends.

	If a receiver's address contains a subject, it is used to
	select only messages that match the subject&mdash;the matching
	algorithm depends on the message source.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In AMQP 0-10, each exchange type has its own matching
	  algorithm. This is discussed in
	  <xref linkend="section-amqp0-10-mapping"/>.
	</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
	    Currently, a receiver bound to a queue ignores subjects,
	    receiving messages from the queue without filtering. Support
	    for subject filtering on queues will be implemented soon.
	  </para>
	</note>


	<example>
	  <title>Using subjects</title>

	  <para>In this example we show how subjects affect message
	  flow.</para>

	  <para>First, let's use <command>qpid-config</command> to create a topic exchange.</para>

	  <screen>
	    $ qpid-config add exchange topic news-service
	  </screen>

	  <para>Now we use drain to receive messages from <literal>news-service</literal> that match the subject <literal>sports</literal>.</para>
	  <para><emphasis>First Window:</emphasis></para>
	  <screen>
	    $ ./drain -t 30 news-service/sports
	  </screen>

	  <para>In a second window, let's send messages to <literal>news-service</literal> using two different subjects:</para>

	  <para><emphasis>Second Window:</emphasis></para>
	  <screen>
	    $ ./spout news-service/sports
	    $ ./spout news-service/news
	  </screen>

	  <para>Now look at the first window, the message with the
	  subject <literal>sports</literal> has been received, but not
	  the message with the subject <literal>news</literal>:</para>

	  <screen>
	    Message(properties={qpid.subject:sports, spout-id:9441674e-a157-4780-a78e-f7ccea998291:0}, content='')
	  </screen>

	  <para>If you run <command>drain</command> in multiple
          windows using the same subject, all instances of
          <command>drain</command> receive the messages for that
          subject.</para>
	</example>


        <para>The AMQP exchange type we are using here,
        <literal>amq.topic</literal>, can also do more sophisticated
        matching.

	A sender's subject can contain multiple words separated by a
	<quote>.</quote> delimiter. For instance, in a news
	application, the sender might use subjects like
	<literal>usa.news</literal>, <literal>usa.weather</literal>,
	<literal>europe.news</literal>, or
	<literal>europe.weather</literal>.

	The receiver's subject can include wildcard characters&mdash;
	<quote>#</quote> matches one or more words in the message's
	subject, <quote>*</quote> matches a single word.

	For instance, if the subject in the source address is
	<literal>*.news</literal>, it matches messages with the
	subject <literal>europe.news</literal> or
	<literal>usa.news</literal>; if it is
	<literal>europe.#</literal>, it matches messages with subjects
	like <literal>europe.news</literal> or
	<literal>europe.pseudo.news</literal>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Subjects with multi-word keys</title>

	  <para>This example uses drain and spout to demonstrate the
	  use of subjects with two-word keys.</para>

	  <para>Let's use <command>drain</command> with the subject
	  <literal>*.news</literal> to listen for messages in which
	  the second word of the key is
	  <literal>news</literal>.</para>

	  <para><emphasis>First Window:</emphasis></para>

	  <screen>
	    $ ./drain -t 30 news-service/*.news

	  <para>Now let's send messages using several different
	  two-word keys:</para>

	  <para><emphasis>Second Window:</emphasis></para>

	  <screen>
	    $ ./spout news-service/usa.news
	    $ ./spout news-service/usa.sports
	    $ ./spout news-service/europe.sports
	    $ ./spout news-service/europe.news
	  </screen>

	  <para>In the first window, the messages with

	  <para>Next, let's use <command>drain</command> with the

	<title>Address String Options</title>

	<para>
	  The options in an address string can contain additional
	  information for the senders or receivers created for it,
	  including:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Policies for assertions about the node to which an address
	      refers.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      For instance, in the address string <literal>my-queue;
	      {assert: always, node:{ type: queue }}</literal>, the node
	      named <literal>my-queue</literal> must be a queue; if not,
	      the address does not resolve to a node, and an exception
	      is raised.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Policies for automatically creating or deleting the node to which an address refers.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      For instance, in the address string <literal>xoxox ; {create: always}</literal>,
	      the queue <literal>xoxox</literal> is created, if it does
	      not exist, before the address is resolved.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Extension points that can be used for sender/receiver configuration.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      For instance, if the address for a receiver is
	      <literal>my-queue; {mode: browse}</literal>, the receiver
	      works in <literal>browse</literal> mode, leaving messages
	      on the queue so other receivers can receive them.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Extension points providing more direct control over the underlying protocol.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      For instance, the <literal>x-bindings</literal> property
	      allows greater control over the AMQP 0-10 binding process
	      when an address is resolved.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>


	<para>
	  Let's use some examples to show how these different kinds of
	  address string options affect the behavior of senders and
	  receives.
	</para>

	<section>
	  <title>assert</title>
	  <para>
	    In this section, we use the <literal>assert</literal> option
	    to ensure that the address resolves to a node of the required
	    type.
	  </para>


	  <example>
	    <title>Assertions on Nodes</title>

	    <para>Let's use <command>qpid-config</command> to create a
	    queue and a topic.</para>

	    <screen>
	      $ qpid-config add queue my-queue
	      $ qpid-config add exchange topic my-topic
	    </screen>

	    <para>
	      We can now use the address specified to drain to assert that it is
	      of a particular type:
	    </para>

	    <screen>
	      $ ./drain 'my-queue; {assert: always, node:{ type: queue }}'
	      $ ./drain 'my-queue; {assert: always, node:{ type: topic }}'
	      2010-04-20 17:30:46 warning Exception received from broker: not-found: not-found: Exchange not found: my-queue (../../src/qpid/broker/ExchangeRegistry.cpp:92) [caused by 2 \x07:\x01]
	      Exchange my-queue does not exist
	    </screen>

	    <para>
	      The first attempt passed without error as my-queue is indeed a
	      queue. The second attempt however failed; my-queue is not a
	      topic.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      We can do the same thing for my-topic:
	    </para>

	    <screen>
	      $ ./drain 'my-topic; {assert: always, node:{ type: topic }}'
	      $ ./drain 'my-topic; {assert: always, node:{ type: queue }}'
	      2010-04-20 17:31:01 warning Exception received from broker: not-found: not-found: Queue not found: my-topic (../../src/qpid/broker/SessionAdapter.cpp:754) [caused by 1 \x08:\x01]
	      Queue my-topic does not exist
	    </screen>
	  </example>

	  <para>Now let's use the <literal>create</literal> option to
	  create the queue <literal>xoxox</literal> if it does not already
	  exist:</para>

	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>create</title>

	  <para>In previous examples, we created the queue before
	  listening for messages on it. Using <literal>create:
	  always</literal>, the queue is automatically created if it
	  does not exist.</para>

	  <example>
	    <title>Creating a Queue Automatically</title>

	    <para><emphasis>First Window:</emphasis></para>
	    <screen>$ ./drain -t 30 "xoxox ; {create: always}"</screen>


	    <para>Now we can send messages to this queue:</para>

	    <para><emphasis>Second Window:</emphasis></para>
	    <screen>$ ./spout "xoxox ; {create: always}"</screen>

	    <para>Returning to the first window, we see that <command>drain</command> has received this message:</para>

	    <screen>Message(properties={spout-id:1a1a3842-1a8b-4f88-8940-b4096e615a7d:0}, content='')</screen>
	  </example>
	  <para>The details of the node thus created can be controlled by further options within the node. See <xref linkend="table-node-properties"/> for details.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>browse</title>
	  <para>Some options specify message transfer semantics; for
	  instance, they may state whether messages should be consumed or
	  read in browsing mode, or specify reliability
	  characteristics. The following example uses the
	  <literal>browse</literal> option to receive messages without
	  removing them from a queue.</para>

	  <example>
	    <title>Browsing a Queue</title>
	    <para>
	      Let's use the browse mode to receive messages without
	      removing them from the queue. First we send three messages to the
	      queue:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
	      $ ./spout my-queue --content one
	      $ ./spout my-queue --content two
	      $ ./spout my-queue --content three
	    </screen>

	    <para>Now we use drain to get those messages, using the browse option:</para>
	    <screen>
	      $ ./drain 'my-queue; {mode: browse}'
	      Message(properties={spout-id:fbb93f30-0e82-4b6d-8c1d-be60eb132530:0}, content='one')
	      Message(properties={spout-id:ab9e7c31-19b0-4455-8976-34abe83edc5f:0}, content='two')
	      Message(properties={spout-id:ea75d64d-ea37-47f9-96a9-d38e01c97925:0}, content='three')
	    </screen>

	    <para>We can confirm the messages are still on the queue by repeating the drain:</para>
	    <screen>
	      $ ./drain 'my-queue; {mode: browse}'
	      Message(properties={spout-id:fbb93f30-0e82-4b6d-8c1d-be60eb132530:0}, content='one')
	      Message(properties={spout-id:ab9e7c31-19b0-4455-8976-34abe83edc5f:0}, content='two')
	      Message(properties={spout-id:ea75d64d-ea37-47f9-96a9-d38e01c97925:0}, content='three')
	    </screen>
	  </example>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>x-bindings</title>

	  <para>Greater control over the AMQP 0-10 binding process can
	  be achieved by including an <literal>x-bindings</literal>
	  option in an address string.

	  For instance, the XML Exchange is an AMQP 0-10 custom exchange
	  provided by the Apache Qpid C++ broker. It allows messages to
	  be filtered using XQuery; queries can address either message
	  properties or XML content in the body of the message. The
	  xquery is specified in the arguments field of the AMQP 0-10
	  command. When using the messaging API an xquery can be
	  specified in and address that resolves to an XML exchange by
	  using the x-bindings property.</para>


	  <para>An instance of the XML Exchange must be added before it
	  can be used:</para>

	  <programlisting>
	    $ qpid-config add exchange xml xml
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>When using the XML Exchange, a receiver provides an
	  XQuery as an x-binding argument. If the query contains a
	  context item (a path starting with <quote>.</quote>), then it
	  is applied to the content of the message, which must be
	  well-formed XML. For instance, <literal>./weather</literal> is
	  a valid XQuery, which matches any message in which the root
	  element is named <literal>weather</literal>. Here is an
	  address string that contains this query:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[
	  xml; {
	  link: {
	  x-bindings: [{exchange:xml, key:weather, arguments:{xquery:"./weather"} }]
	  }
	  }
	  ]]></programlisting>

	  <para>When using longer queries with <command>drain</command>,
	  it is often useful to place the query in a file, and use
	  <command>cat</command> in the command line. We do this in the
	  following example.</para>

	  <example>
	    <title>Using the XML Exchange</title>

	    <para>This example uses an x-binding that contains queries, which filter based on the content of XML messages. Here is an XQuery that we will use in this example:</para>

	    <programlisting>
	      <![CDATA[
		       let $w := ./weather
		       return $w/station = 'Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU)'
		       and $w/temperature_f > 50
		       and $w/temperature_f - $w/dewpoint > 5
		       and $w/wind_speed_mph > 7
		       and $w/wind_speed_mph < 20 ]]>
	    </programlisting>

	    <para>We can specify this query in an x-binding to listen to messages that meet the criteria specified by the query:</para>

	    <para><emphasis>First Window:</emphasis></para>

	    <screen>
	      $ ./drain -f "xml; {link:{x-bindings:[{key:'weather',
	      arguments:{xquery:\"$(cat rdu.xquery )\"}}]}}"
	    </screen>

	    <para>In another window, let's create an XML message that meets the criteria in the query, and place it in the file <filename>rdu.xml</filename>:</para>

	    <programlisting>
	      <![CDATA[
		       <weather>
		       <station>Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU)</station>
		       <wind_speed_mph>16</wind_speed_mph>
		       <temperature_f>70</temperature_f>
		       <dewpoint>35</dewpoint>
		       </weather>
	      ]]></programlisting>

	      <para>Now let's use <command>spout</command> to send this message to the XML exchange:</para>

	      <para><emphasis>Second Window:</emphasis></para>
	      <screen>
		spout --content "$(cat rdu.xml)" xml/weather
	      </screen>

	      <para>Returning to the first window, we see that the message has been received:</para>

	      <screen><![CDATA[$ ./drain -f "xml; {link:{x-bindings:[{exchange:'xml', key:'weather', arguments:{xquery:\"$(cat rdu.xquery )\"}}]}}"

    <section id="replay">
      <title>Sender Capacity and Replay</title>

      <para>The send method of a sender has an optional second parameter
      that controls whether the send call is synchronous or not. A
      synchronous send call will block until the broker has confirmed
      receipt of the message. An asynchronous send call will return
      before the broker confirms receipt of the message, allowing for
      example further send calls to be made without waiting for a
      roundtrip to the broker for each message. This is desirable where
      increased throughput is important.</para>

      <para>The sender maintains a list of sent messages whose receipt
      has yet to be confirmed by the broker. The maximum number of such
      messages that it will hold is defined by the capacity of the
      sender, which can be set by the application. If an application
      tries to send with a sender whose capacity is already fully used
      up, the send call will block waiting for capacity regardless of
      the value of the sync flag.</para>

      <para>The sender can be queried for the available space (i.e. the
      unused capacity), and for the current count of unsettled messages
      (i.e. those held in the replay list pending confirmation by the
      server). When the unsettled count is zero, all messages on that
      sender have been successfully sent.</para>

      <para>If the connection fails and is transparently reconnected
      (see <xref linkend="connection-options"/> for details on how to control
      this feature), the unsettled messages for each sender over that
      connection will be re-transmitted. This provides a transparent
      level of reliability. This feature can be controlled through the
      link's reliability as defined in the address (see
      <xref linkend="table-link-properties"/>). At present only
      at-least-once guarantees are offered. </para>
    </section>

    <section id="prefetch">
      <title>Receiver Capacity (Prefetch)</title>

      <para>By default, a receiver requests the next message from the
      server in response to each fetch call, resulting in messages being
      sent to the receiver one at a time. As in the case of sending, it
      is often desirable to avoid this roundtrip for each message. This
      can be achieved by allowing the receiver
      to <firstterm>prefetch</firstterm> messages in anticipation of
      fetch calls being made. The receiver needs to be able to store
      these prefetched messages, the number it can hold is controlled by
      the receivers capacity.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="acknowledgements">
      <title>Acknowledging Received Messages</title>

      <para>Applications that receive messages should acknowledge their
      receipt by calling the session's acknowledge method. As in the
      case of sending messages, acknowledged transfer of messages to
      receivers provides at-least-once reliability, which means that the
      loss of the connection or a client crash does not result in lost
      messages; durable messages are not lost even if the broker is
      restarted.

      Some cases may not require this however and the reliability can be
      controlled through a link property in the address options (see
      <xref linkend="table-link-properties"/>).</para>

      <para>The acknowledge call acknowledges all messages received on
      the session (i.e. all message that have been returned from a fetch
      call on a receiver created on that session).</para>

      <para>The acknowledge call also support an optional parameter
      controlling whether the call is synchronous or not. A synchronous
      acknowledge will block until the server has confirmed that it has
      received the acknowledgement. In the asynchronous case, when the
      call returns there is not yet any guarantee that the server has
      received and processed the acknowledgement. The session may be
      queried for the number of unsettled acknowledgements; when that
      count is zero all acknowledgements made for received messages have
      been successful.</para>

    </section>


    <section>
      <title>Receiving Messages from Multiple Sources</title>

      <para>A receiver can only read from one source, but many
      programs need to be able to read messages from many sources. In
      the Qpid Messaging API, a program can ask a session for
      the <quote>next receiver</quote>; that is, the receiver that is
      responsible for the next available message. The following
      examples show how this is done in C++, Python, and .NET C#.
      </para>

      <para>Note that to use this pattern you must enable prefetching
      for each receiver of interest so that the broker will send
      messages before a fetch call is made. See
      <xref linkend="prefetch"/> for more on this.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Receiving Messages from Multiple Sources</title>

	<para>C++:</para>

	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	Receiver receiver1 = session.createReceiver(address1);
	receiver1.setCapacity(10);
	Receiver receiver2 = session.createReceiver(address2);
	receiver2.setCapacity(10);

	Message message =  session.nextReceiver().fetch();
	std::cout << message.getContent() << std::endl;
	session.acknowledge(); // acknowledge message receipt
	]]>	  </programlisting>

	<para>Python:</para>
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	receiver1 = session.receiver(address1)
	receiver1.capacity = 10
	receiver2 = session.receiver(address)
	receiver2.capacity = 10
	message = session.next_receiver().fetch()
	print message.content
	session.acknowledge()
	]]>	  </programlisting>

	<para>.NET C#:</para>
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	Receiver receiver1 = session.CreateReceiver(address1);
	receiver1.Capacity = 10;
	Receiver receiver2 = session.CreateReceiver(address2);
	receiver2.Capacity = 10;

	Message message = new Message();
	message =  session.NextReceiver().Fetch();
	Console.WriteLine("{0}", message.GetContent());
	session.Acknowledge();
	]]>	  </programlisting>

      </example>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Transactions</title>

      <para>Sometimes it is useful to be able to group messages
      transfers - sent and/or received - on a session into atomic
      grouping. This can be done be creating the session as
      transactional. On a transactional session sent messages only
      become available at the target address on commit. Likewise any
      received and acknowledged messages are only discarded at their
      source on commit

      <footnote><para>Note that this currently is only true for
      messages received using a reliable mode
      e.g. at-least-once. Messages sent by a broker to a receiver in
      unreliable receiver will be discarded immediately regardless of
      transctionality.</para></footnote>

      <example>
	<title>Transactions</title>
	<para>C++:</para>

      <title>The Request / Response Pattern</title>
      <para>Request / Response applications use the reply-to property,
      described in <xref
      linkend="table-amqp0-10-message-properties"/>, to allow a server
      to respond to the client that sent a message. A server sets up a
      service queue, with a name known to clients. A client creates a
      private queue for the server's response, creates a message for a
      request, sets the request's reply-to property to the address of
      the client's response queue, and sends the request to the
      service queue. The server sends the response to the address
      specified in the request's reply-to property.
      </para>
      <example>
	<title>Request / Response Applications in C++</title>

	<para>This example shows the C++ code for a client and server
	that use the request / response pattern.</para>

	<para>The server creates a service queue and waits for a
	message to arrive. If it receives a message, it sends a
	message back to the sender.</para>

	Sender sender = session.createSender(address); // ... send response to "reply-to"
	Message response("pong!");
	sender.send(response);
	session.acknowledge();
	}
	]]></programlisting>

	<para>The client creates a sender for the service queue, and
	also creates a response queue that is deleted when the
	client closes the receiver for the response queue. In the C++
	client, if the address starts with the character
	<literal>#</literal>, it is given a unique name.</para>

	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	Sender sender = session.createSender("service_queue");

	Address responseQueue("#response-queue; {create:always, delete:always}");

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
          <para>Consider prefetching messages for receivers (see
          <xref linkend="prefetch"/>). This helps eliminate roundtrips
          and increases throughput. Prefetch is disabled by default,
          and enabling it is the most effective means of improving
          throughput of received messages.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
          <para>Send messages asynchronously. Again, this helps
          eliminate roundtrips and increases throughput. The C++ and
          .NET clients send asynchronously by default, however the
          python client defaults to synchronous sends.  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
          <para>Acknowledge messages in batches (see
          <xref linkend="acknowledgements"/>). Rather than
          acknowledging each message individually, consider issuing
          acknowledgements after n messages and/or after a particular
          duration has elapsed.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
          <para>Tune the sender capacity (see
          <xref linkend="replay"/>). If the capacity is too low the
          sender may block waiting for the broker to confirm receipt
          of messages, before it can free up more capacity.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
          <para>If you are setting a reply-to address on messages
          being sent by the c++ client, make sure the address type is
          set to either queue or topic as appropriate. This avoids the
          client having to determine which type of node is being
          refered to, which is required when hanling reply-to in AMQP
          0-10. </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>For latency sensitive applications, setting tcp-nodelay
	  on qpidd and on client connections can help reduce the
	  latency.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <section>
      <title>Cluster Failover</title>

      <para>The messaging broker can be run in clustering mode, which provides high reliability through replicating state between brokers in the cluster. If one broker in a cluster fails, clients can choose another broker in the cluster and continue their work. Each broker in the cluster also advertises the addresses of all known brokers

      <footnote><para>This is done via the amq.failover exchange in AMQP 0-10</para></footnote>

      . A client can use this information to dynamically keep the list of reconnection urls up to date.</para>

      <para>In C++, the <classname>FailoverUpdates</classname> class provides this functionality:</para>

      <example>
	<title>Tracking cluster membership</title>

	<para>In C++:</para>

	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	#include <qpid/messaging/FailoverUpdates.h>

	connection.setOption("reconnect", true);
	try {
	connection.open();

      <title>Logging</title>

      <para>To simplify debugging, Qpid provides a logging facility
      that prints out messaging events.</para>

      <section>
	<title>Logging in C++</title>
	<para>
	  The Qpidd broker and C++ clients can both use environment variables to enable logging. Linux and Windows systems use the same named environment variables and values.
	</para>
	<para>Use QPID_LOG_ENABLE to set the level of logging you are interested in (trace, debug, info, notice, warning, error, or critical):
	</para>

	<screen>
	  export QPID_LOG_ENABLE=&#34;warning+&#34;
	</screen>
	<para>
	  The Qpidd broker and C++ clients use QPID_LOG_OUTPUT to determine where logging output should be sent. This is either a file name or the special values stderr, stdout, or syslog:
	</para>

	<screen>
	  export QPID_LOG_TO_FILE=&#34;/tmp/myclient.out&#34;
	</screen>

	<para>
	  From a Windows command prompt, use the following command format to set the environment variables:
	</para>

	<screen>
	  set QPID_LOG_ENABLE=warning+
	  set QPID_LOG_TO_FILE=D:\tmp\myclient.out
	</screen>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Logging in Python</title>
	<para>
	  The Python client library supports logging using the standard Python logging module. The easiest way to do logging is to use the <command>basicConfig()</command>, which reports all warnings and errors:
	</para>

	<programlisting>from logging import basicConfig
	basicConfig()
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Qpidd also provides a convenience method that makes it easy to specify the level of logging desired. For instance, the following code enables logging at the <command>DEBUG</command> level:
	</para>

	<programlisting>from qpid.log import enable, DEBUG
	enable("qpid.messaging.io", DEBUG)
	</programlisting>
	<para>

      <title>The AMQP 0-10 mapping</title>

      <para>
	This section describes the AMQP 0-10 mapping for the Qpid
	Messaging API.
      </para>
      <para>
        The interaction with the broker triggered by creating a sender
        or receiver depends on what the specified address resolves
        to. Where the node type is not specified in the address, the
        client queries the broker to determine whether it refers to a
        queue or an exchange.
      </para>
      <para>
        When sending to a queue, the queue's name is set as the
        routing key and the message is transfered to the default (or
        nameless) exchange. When sending to an exchange, the message
        is transfered to that exchange and the routing key is set to
        the message subject if one is specified. A default subject may
        be specified in the target address. The subject may also be
        set on each message individually to override the default if
        required. In each case any specified subject is also added as
        a qpid.subject entry in the application-headers field of the
        message-properties.
      </para>
      <para>
        When receiving from a queue, any subject in the source address
        is currently ignored. The client sends a message-subscribe
        request for the queue in question. The accept-mode is
        determined by the reliability option in the link properties;
        for unreliable links the accept-mode is none, for reliable
        links it is explicit. The default for a queue is reliable. The
        acquire-mode is determined by the value of the mode option. If
        the mode is set to browse the acquire mode is not-acquired,
        otherwise it is set to pre-acquired. The exclusive and
        arguments fields in the message-subscribe command can be
        controlled using the x-subscribe map.
      </para>
      <para>
        When receiving from an exchange, the client creates a
        subscription queue and binds that to the exchange. The
        subscription queue's arguments can be specified using the
        x-declare map within the link properties. The reliability
        option determines most of the other parameters. If the
        reliability is set to unreliable then an auto-deleted,
        exclusive queue is used meaning that if the client or
        connection fails messages may be lost. For exactly-once the
        queue is not set to be auto-deleted. The durability of the
        subscription queue is determined by the durable option in the
        link properties. The binding process depends on the type of
        the exchange the source address resolves to.

      <itemizedlist>

          <para>
            For a topic exchange, if no subject is specified and no
            x-bindings are defined for the link, the subscription
            queue is bound using a wildcard matching any routing key
            (thus satisfying the expectation that any message sent to
            that address will be received from it). If a subject is
            specified in the source address however, it is used for
            the binding key (this means that the subject in the source
            address may be a binding pattern including wildcards).

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            For a fanout exchange the binding key is irrelevant to
            matching. A receiver created from a source address that
            resolves to a fanout exchange receives all messages
            sent to that exchange regardless of any subject the source
            address may contain. An x-bindings element in the link
            properties should be used if there is any need to set the
            arguments to the bind.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            For a direct exchange, the subject is used as the binding
            key. If no subject is specified an empty string is used as
            the binding key.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            For a headers exchange, if no subject is specified the
            binding arguments simply contain an x-match entry and no
            other entries, causing all messages to match. If a subject
            is specified then the binding arguments contain an x-match
            entry set to all and an entry for qpid.subject whose value
            is the subject in the source address (this means the
            subject in the source address must match the message
            subject exactly). For more control the x-bindings element
            in the link properties must be used.

            For the XML exchange,<footnote><para>Note that the XML
            exchange is not a standard AMQP exchange type. It is a
            Qpid extension and is currently only supported by the C++
            broker.</para></footnote> if a subject is specified it is
            used as the binding key and an XQuery is defined that
            matches any message with that value for
            qpid.subject. Again this means that only messages whose
            subject exactly match that specified in the source address
            are received. If no subject is specified then the empty
            string is used as the binding key with an xquery that will
            match any message (this means that only messages with an
            empty string as the routing key will be received). For more
            control the x-bindings element in the link properties must
            be used. A source address that resolves to the XML
            exchange must contain either a subject or an x-bindings
            element in the link properties as there is no way at
            present to receive any message regardless of routing key.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        If an x-bindings list is present in the link options a binding
        is created for each element within that list. Each element is
        a nested map that may contain values named queue, exchange,
        key or arguments. If the queue value is absent the queue name
        the address resolves to is implied. If the exchange value is
        absent the exchange name the address resolves to is implied.

    <title>Using the Qpid JMS client</title>
    <section>
      <title>A Simple Messaging Program in Java JMS</title>

      <para>The following program shows how to send and receive a
      message using the Qpid JMS client. JMS programs typically use
      JNDI to obtain connection factory and destination objects which
      the application needs. In this way the configuration is kept
      separate from the application code itself.</para>

      <para>In this example, we create a JNDI context using a
      properties file, use the context to lookup a connection factory,
      create and start a connection, create a session, and lookup a
      destination from the JNDI context. Then we create a producer and
      a consumer, send a message with the producer and receive it with
      the consumer. This code should be straightforward for anyone
      familiar with Java JMS.</para>

      <example>
	<title>"Hello world!" in Java</title>
	<programlisting lang="java">

	<para>
	  A broker list can contain more than one broker address; if so, the connection is made to the first broker in the list that is available. In general, it is better to use the failover exchange when using multiple brokers, since it allows applications to fail over if a broker goes down.

      <title>JMS Client Logging</title>
      <para>The JMS Client logging is handled using the Simple Logging Facade for Java (<ulink url="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</ulink>). As the name implies, slf4j is a facade that delegates to other logging systems like log4j or JDK 1.4 logging. For more information on how to configure slf4j for specific logging systems, please consult the slf4j documentation.</para>

      <para>When using the log4j binding, please set the log level for org.apache.qpid explicitly. Otherwise log4j will default to DEBUG which will degrade performance considerably due to excessive logging. The recommended logging level for production is <literal>WARN</literal>.</para>

      <para>The following example shows the logging properties used to configure client logging for slf4j using the log4j binding. These properties can be placed in a log4j.properties file and placed in the <varname>CLASSPATH</varname>, or they can be set explicitly using the <literal>-Dlog4j.configuration</literal> property.</para>

      <para>The Qpid JMS Client allows several configuration options to customize it's behaviour at different levels of granualarity.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            JVM level using JVM arguments : Configuration that affects all connections, sessions, consumers and producers created within that JVM.
	  </para>
          <para>Ex. <varname>-Dmax_prefetch=1000</varname> property specifies the message credits to use.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Connection level using Connection/Broker properties : Affects the respective connection and sessions, consumers and produces created by that connection.
	  </para>
          <para>Ex. <varname>amqp://guest:guest@test/test?max_prefetch='1000'
	  &amp;brokerlist='tcp://localhost:5672'
	  </varname> property specifies the message credits to use. This overrides any value specified via the JVM argument <varname>max_prefetch</varname>.</para>
          <para>Please refer to the <xref linkend="section-jms-connection-url"/> section for a complete list of all properties and how to use them.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Destination level using Addressing options : Affects the producer(s) and consumer(s) created using the respective destination.
	  </para>
          <para>Ex. <varname>my-queue; {create: always, link:{capacity: 10}}</varname>, where <varname>capacity</varname> option specifies the message credits to use. This overrides any connection level configuration.</para>
          <para>Please refer to the <xref linkend="section-addresses"/> section for a complete understanding of addressing and it's various options.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Some of these config options are available at all three levels (Ex. <varname>max_prefetch</varname>), while others are available only at JVM or connection level.</para>

      <para>The Qpid WCF client provides two bindings, each with support for
      Windows .NET transactions.</para>

      <para>The AmqpBinding is suitable for communication between two WCF
      applications.  By default it uses the WCF binary .NET XML encoder
      (BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement) for efficient message
      transmission, but it can also use the text and Message Transmission
      Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) encoders.  Here is a traditional service
      model sample program using the AmqpBinding.  It assumes that the queue
      "hello_service_node" has been created and configured on the AMQP
      broker.</para>

      <para>The second binding, AmqpBinaryBinding, is suitable for WCF
      applications that need to inter-operate with non-WCF clients or that
      wish to have direct access to the raw wire representation of the
      message body.  It relies on a custom encoder to read and write raw
      (binary) content which operates similarly to the ByteStream encoder
      (introduced in .NET 4.0).  The encoder presents an abstract XML
      infoset view of the raw message content on input.  On output, the
      encoder does the reverse and peels away the XML infoset layer exposing
      the raw content to the wire representation of the message body.  The
      application must do the inverse of what the encoder does to allow the
      XML infoset wrapper to cancel properly.  This is demonstrated in the
      following sample code (using the channel programming model) which
      directly manipulates or provides callbacks to the WCF message readers
      and writers when the content is consumed.  In contrast to the
      AmqpBinding sample where the simple greeting is encapsulated in a
      compressed SOAP envelope, the wire representation of the message
      contains the raw content and is identical and fully interoperable with
      the Qpid C++ "Hello world!"  example.</para>

      <title>Endpoints</title>

      <para>In Qpid 0.6 the WCF Endpoints map to simple AMQP 0-10
      exchanges (IOutputChannel) or AMQP 0-10 queues (IInputChannel).
      The format for an IOutputChannel is</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
  "amqp:amq.direct" or "amqp:my_exchange?routingkey=my_routing_key"
]]></programlisting>

      <para>and for an IInputChannel is</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
  "amqp:my_queue"
]]></programlisting>

      <para>The routing key is in fact a default value associated with
      the particular channel.  Outgoing messages can always have their
      routing key uniquely set.</para>

      <para>If the respective queue or exchange doesn't exist, an exception
      is thrown when opening the channel.  Queues and exchanges can be
      created and configured using qpid-config.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Message Headers</title>

      <para>AMQP specific message headers can be set on or retrieved
      from the ServiceModel.Channels.Message using the AmqpProperties
      type.</para>

      <para>For example, on output:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
AmqpProperties props = new AmqpProperties();
props.Durable = true;
props.PropertyMap.Add("my_custom_header", new AmqpString("a custom value"));
Message msg = Message.CreateMessage(args);
msg.Properties.Add("AmqpProperties", amqpProperties);
outputChannel.Send(msg);
]]></programlisting>

      <para>On input the headers can be accessed from the Message or extracted
      from the operation context</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
public void SayHello(string greeting)
{
  AmqpProperties props = (AmqpProperties) OperationContext.
  Current.IncomingMessageProperties["AmqpProperties"];
  AmqpString extra = (AmqpString) props.PropertyMap["my_custom_header"];
  Console.WriteLine("Service received: {0} and {1}", greeting, extra);
}

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Security</title>

      <para>To engage TLS/SSL:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
binding.Security.Mode = AmqpSecurityMode.Transport;
binding.Security.Transport.UseSSL = true;
binding.BrokerPort = 5671;
]]></programlisting>

      <para>Currently the WCF client only provides SASL PLAIN (i.e. username and
      password) authentication.  To provide a username and password, you can
      set the DefaultAmqpCredential value in the binding.  This value can be
      overridden or set for a binding's channel factories and listeners,
      either by setting the ClientCredentials as a binding parameter, or by
      using an AmqpCredential as a binding parameter.  The search order for
      credentials is the AmqpCredential binding parameter, followed by the
      ClientCredentials (unless IgnoreEndpointClientCredentials has been
      set), and finally defaulting to the DefaultAmqpCredential of the
      binding itself.  Here is a sample using ClientCredentials:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
ClientCredentials credentials = new ClientCredentials();
credentials.UserName.UserName = "guest";
credentials.UserName.Password = "guest";
bindingParameters = new BindingParameterCollection();
bindingParameters.Add(credentials);
readerFactory = binding.BuildChannelFactory<IInputChannel>(bindingParameters);
]]></programlisting>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Transactions</title>

      <para>The WCF channel provides a transaction resource manager
      module and a recovery module that together provide distributed
      transaction support with one-phase optimization.  Some
      configuration is required on Windows machines to enable
      transaction support (see your installation notes or top level
      ReadMe.txt file for instructions).  Once properly configured,
      the Qpid WCF channel acts as any other System.Transactions aware
      resource, capable of participating in explicit or implicit
      transactions.</para>

      <para>Server code:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
[OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true,
                   TransactionAutoComplete = true)]

public void SayHello(string greeting)
{
  // increment ExactlyOnceReceived counter on DB

  // Success: transaction auto completes:
}
]]></programlisting>

      <para>Because this operation involves two transaction resources, the
      database and the AMQP message broker, this operates as a full two
      phase commit transaction managed by the Distributed Transaction
      Coordinator service.  If the transaction proceeds without error,
      both ExactlyOnceReceived is incremented in the database and the AMQP
      message is consumed from the broker.  Otherwise, ExactlyOnceReceived is
      unchanged and AMQP message is returned to its queue on the broker.</para>

      <para>For the client code a few changes are made to the non-transacted
      example.  For "exactly once" semantics, we set the AMQP "Durable"
      message property and enclose the transacted activities in a
      TransactionScope:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
AmqpProperties myDefaults = new AmqpProperties();
myDefaults.Durable = true;
amqpBinding.DefaultMessageProperties = myDefaults;
ChannelFactory<IHelloService> channelFactory =
new ChannelFactory<IHelloService>(amqpBinding, clientEndpoint);
IHelloService clientProxy = channelFactory.CreateChannel();

using (TransactionScope ts = new TransactionScope())
{
   AmqpProperties amqpProperties = new AmqpProperties();
   clientProxy.SayHello("Greetings from WCF client");
   // increment ExactlyOnceSent counter on DB
   ts.Complete();
}

	The SessionReceiver class provides a convenient callback
	mechanism for Messages received by all Receivers on a given
	Session.

      <para>
	To use this class a client program includes references to both
	Org.Apache.Qpid.Messaging and Org.Apache.Qpid.Messaging.SessionReceiver.
	The calling program creates a function that implements the
	ISessionReceiver interface. This function will be called whenever
	message is received by the session. The callback process is started
	by creating a CallbackServer and will continue to run until the
	client program calls the CallbackServer.Close function.
      </para>
      <para>
	A complete operating example of using the SessionReceiver callback
	is contained in cpp/bindings/qpid/dotnet/examples/csharp.map.callback.receiver.

<!--
   - client code remains exactly the same, but routing behavior
   changes
   - exchanges drop messages if nobody is listening, so we need to
   start drain first
   - drain will exit immediately if the source is empty (note that
   this is actually a semantic guarantee provided by the API, we
   know for a fact that the source is empty when drain/fetch
   reports it, no fudge factor timeout is required [this assumes
   nobody is concurrently publishing of course])
   - drain -f invokes blocking fetch (you could use a timeout here also)
