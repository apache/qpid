Notes on new cluster implementation. See also: new-cluster-design.txt

* Implementation plan.

Co-existence with old cluster code and tests:
- Separate plugin cluster2, options --cluster2-*. Eventually renamed to replace cluster.
- Double up tests with old version/new version as the new code develops.

Minimal POC for message delivery & perf test.
- no wiring replication, no updates, no failover, no persistence, no async completion.
- just implement publish and acquire/dequeue locking protocol.
- optimize the special case where all consumers are on the same node.
- measure performance: compare active-passive and active-active modes of use.

Full implementation of transient cluster
- Update (based on existing update), async completion etc.
- Passing all existing transient cluster tests.

Persistent cluster
- Make sure async completion works correctly.
- InitialStatus protoocl etc. to support persistent start-up (existing code)
- cluster restart from store: stores not identical. Load one, update the rest.
 - assign cluster ID's to messages recovered from store, don't replicate.

Improved update protocol
- per-queue, less stalling, bounded catch-up.

* Task list

** TODO [#A] Minimal POC: publish/acquire/dequeue protocol.

NOTE: as implementation questions arise, take the easiest option and make
a note for later optimization/improvement.

*** Tests
- python test: 4 senders, numbered messages, 4 receivers, verify message set.
- acquire then release messages: verify can be dequeued on any member
- acquire then kill broker: verify can be dequeued other members.
- acquire then reject: verify goes on alt-exchange once only.

*** DONE broker::Cluster interface and call points.

Initial interface commited.

*** Main classes

BrokerHandler:
- implements broker::Cluster intercept points.
- sends mcast events to inform cluster of local actions.
- thread safe, called in connection threads.

LocalMessageMap:
- Holds local messages while they are being enqueued.
- thread safe: called by both BrokerHandler and MessageHandler

MessageHandler:
- handles delivered mcast messages related to messages.
- initiates local actions in response to mcast events.
- thread unsafe, only called in deliver thread.
- maintains view of cluster state regarding messages.

QueueOwnerHandler:
- handles delivered mcast messages related to queue consumer ownership.
- thread safe, called in deliver, connection and timer threads.
- maintains view of cluster state regarding queue ownership.

cluster::Core: class to hold new cluster together (replaces cluster::Cluster)
- thread safe: manage state used by both MessageHandler and BrokerHandler

The following code sketch illustrates only the "happy path" error handling
is omitted.

*** BrokerHandler
Types:
- struct QueuedMessage { Message msg; QueueName q; SequenceNumber position; }
- struct

NOTE:
- Messages on queues are identified by a queue name + a position.
- Messages being routed are identified by a sequence number.

Members:
- thread_local bool noReplicate // suppress replication.
- thread_local bool isRouting // suppress operations while routing
- Message localMessage[SequenceNumber] // local messages being routed.
- thread_local SequenceNumber routingSequence

NOTE: localMessage is also modified by MessageHandler.

broker::Cluster intercept functions:

routing(msg)
  if noReplicate: return
  # Supress everything except enqueues while we are routing.
  # We don't want to replicate acquires & dequeues caused by an enqueu,
  # e.g. removal of messages from ring/LV queues.
  isRouting = true

enqueue(qmsg):
  if noReplicate: return
  if routingSequence == 0 # thread local
    routingSequence = nextRoutingSequence()
    mcast create(encode(qmsg.msg),routingSeq)
  mcast enqueue(qmsg.q,routingSeq)

routed(msg):
  if noReplicate: return
  isRouting = false

acquire(qmsg):
  if noReplicate: return
  if isRouting: return # Ignore while we are routing a message.
  if msg.id: mcast acquire(qmsg)

release(QueuedMessage)
  if noReplicate: return
  if isRouting: return # Ignore while we are routing a message.
  mcast release(qmsg)

accept(QueuedMessage):
  if noReplicate: return
  if isRouting: return # Ignore while we are routing a message.
  mcast accept(qmsg)

reject(QueuedMessage):
  isRejecting = true
  mcast reject(qmsg)

*** MessageHandler and mcast messages
Types:
- struct QueueEntry { QueuedMessage qmsg; NodeId acquired; }
- struct QueueKey { MessageId id; QueueName q; }
- typedef map<QueueKey, QueueEntry> Queue
- struct Node { Message routing[SequenceNumber]; list<QueueKey> acquired; }

Members:
- QueueEntry enqueued[QueueKey]
- Node node[NodeId]

Mcast messages in Message class:

create(msg,seq)
  if sender != self: node[sender].routing[seq] = decode(msg)

enqueue(q,seq):
  id = (sender,seq)
  if sender == self:
    enqueued[id,q] = (localMessage[seq], acquired=None)
  else:
    msg = sender.routing[seq]
    enqueued[id,q] = (qmsg, acquired=None)
    with noReplicate=true: qmsg = broker.getQueue(q).push(msg)

routed(seq):
  if sender == self: localMessage.erase(msg.id.seq)
  else: sender.routing.erase(seq)

acquire(id,q):
  enqueued[id,q].acquired = sender
  node[sender].acquired.push_back((id,q))
  if sender != self:
    with noReplicate=true: broker.getQueue(q).acquire(enqueued[id,q])

release(id,q)
  enqueued[id,q].acquired = None
  node[sender].acquired.erase((id,q))
  if sender != self
    with noReplicate=true: broker.getQueue(q).requeue(enqueued[id,q])

reject(id,q):
  sender.routing[id] = enqueued[id,q] # prepare for re-queueing

rejected(id,q)
  sender.routing.erase[id]

dequeue(id,q)
  entry = enqueued[id,q]
  enqueued.erase[id,q]
  node[entry.acquired].acquired.erase(id,q)
  if sender != self:
    with noReplicate=true: broker.getQueue(q).dequeue(entry.qmsg)

member m leaves cluster:
  for key in node[m].acquired:
   release(key.id, key.q)
  node.erase(m)

*** Queue consumer locking

When a queue is locked it does not deliver messages to its consumers.

New broker::Queue functions:
- stopConsumers(): set consumersStopped flag, wait for currently busy consumers to exit.
- startConsumers(): reset consumersStopped flag

Implementation sketch, locking omitted:

void Queue::stopConsumers() {
  consumersStopped = true;
  while (consumersBusy) consumersBusyMonitor.wait();
}

void Queue::startConsumers() {
  consumersStopped = false;
  listeners.notify();
}

bool Queue::dispatch(consumer) {
   if (consumersStopped) return false;
   ++consumersBusy;
   do_regular_dispatch_body()
   if (--consumersBusy == 0) consumersBusyMonitor.notify();
}

*** QueueOwnerHandler

Invariants:
- Each queue is owned by at most one node at any time.
- Each node is interested in a set of queues at any given time.
- A queue is un-owned if no node is interested.

The queue owner releases the queue when
- it loses interest i.e. queue has no consumers with credit.
- a configured time delay expires and there are other interested nodes.

The owner mcasts release(q). On delivery the new queue owner is the
next node in node-id order (treating nodes as a circular list)
starting from the old owner that is interested in the queue.

Queue consumers initially are stopped, only started when we get
ownership from the cluster.

Thread safety: called by deliver, connection and timer threads, needs locking.

Thread safe object per queue holding queue ownership status.
Called by deliver, connection and timer threads.

class QueueOwnership {
  bool owned;
  Timer timer;
  BrokerQueue q;

  drop(): # locked
    if owned:
      owned = false
      q.stopConsumers()
      mcast release(q.name, false)
      timer.stop()

  take(): # locked
    if not owned:
      owned = true
      q.startConsumers()
      timer.start(timeout)

  timer.fire(): drop()
}

Data Members, only modified/examined in deliver thread:
- typedef set<NodeId> ConsumerSet
- map<QueueName, ConsumerSet> consumers
- map<QueueName, NodeId> owner

Thread safe data members, accessed in connection threads (via BrokerHandler):
- map<QueueName, QueueOwnership> ownership

Multicast messages in QueueOwner class:

consume(q):
  if sender==self and consumers[q].empty(): ownership[q].take()
  consumers[q].insert(sender)

release(q):
  asssert(owner[q] == sender and owner[q] in consumers[q])
  owner[q] = circular search from sender in consumers[q]
  if owner==self: ownership[q].take()

cancel(q):
  assert(queue[q].owner != sender) # sender must release() before cancel()
  consumers[q].erase(sender)

member-leaves:
  for q in queue: if owner[q] = left: left.release(q)

Need 2 more intercept points in broker::Cluster:

consume(q,consumer,consumerCount) - Queue::consume()
  if consumerCount == 1: mcast consume(q)

cancel(q,consumer,consumerCount) - Queue::cancel()
  if consumerCount == 0:
    ownership[q].drop()
  mcast cancel(q)

#TODO: lifecycle, updating cluster data structures when queues are destroyed

*** Increasing concurrency
The major performance limitation of the old cluster is that it does
everything in the single CPG deliver thread context.

We can get additional concurrency by creating a thread context _per queue_
for queue operations: enqueue, acquire, accept etc.

We associate a PollableQueue of queue operations with each AMQP queue.
The CPG deliver thread would
- build messages and associate with cluster IDs.
- push queue ops to the appropriate PollableQueue to be dispatched the queues thread.

Serializing operations on the same queue avoids contention, but takes advantage
of the independence of operations on separate queues.

*** Re-use of existing cluster code
- re-use Event
- re-use Multicaster
- re-use same PollableQueueSetup (may experiment later)
- new Core class to replace Cluster.
- keep design modular, keep threading rules clear.

** TODO [#B] Large message replication.
Multicast should encode messages in fixed size buffers (64k)?
Can't assume we can send message in one chunk.
For 0-10 can use channel numbers & send whole frames packed into larger buffer.
** TODO [#B] Transaction support.
Extend broker::Cluster interface to capture transaction context and completion.
Sequence number to generate per-node tx IDs.
Replicate transaction completion.
** TODO [#B] Management support
- Replicate management methods that modify queues - e.g. move, purge.
- Report connections - local only or cluster-wide?
** TODO [#B] Batch CPG multicast messages
The new cluster design involves a lot of small multicast messages,
they need to be batched into larger CPG messages for efficiency.
** TODO [#B] Genuine async completion
Replace current synchronous waiting implementation with genuine async completion.

Test: enhance test_store.cpp to defer enqueueComplete till special message received.

Async callback uses *requestIOProcessing* to queue action on IO thread.

** TODO [#B] Async completion of accept when dequeue completes.
Interface is already there on broker::Message, just need to ensure
that store and cluster implementations call it appropriately.

** TODO [#B] Replicate wiring.
From messageStore create/destroy/bind, replicate encoded declare/destroy/bind command.

** TODO [#B] New members joining - first pass

Re-use update code from old cluster but don't replicate sessions &
connections.

Need to extend it to send cluster IDs with messages.

Need to replicate the queue ownership data as part of the update.

** TODO [#B] Persistence support.
InitialStatus protoocl etc. to support persistent start-up (existing code)

Only one broker recovers from store, update to others.

Assign cluster IDs to messages recovered from store, don't replicate. See Queue::recover.

** TODO [#B] Handle other ways that messages can leave a queue.

Other ways (other than via a consumer) that messages are take off a queue.

NOTE: Not controlled by queue lock, how to make them consistent?

Target broker may not have all messages on other brokers for purge/destroy.
- Queue::move() - need to wait for lock? Replicate?
- Queue::get() - ???
- Queue::purge() - replicate purge? or just delete what's on broker ?
- Queue::destroy() - messages to alternate exchange on all brokers.?

Need to add callpoints & mcast messages to replicate these?

** TODO [#B] Flow control for internal queues.

Need to bound the size of internal queues: delivery and multicast.
- stop polling for read on client connections when we reach a bound.
- restart polling when we get back under it.

That will stop local multicasting, we still have to deal with remote
multicasting (note existing cluster does not do this.) Something like:
- when over bounds multicast a flow-control event.
- on delivery of flow-control all members stop polling to read client connections
- when back under bounds send flow-control-end, all members resume
- if flow-controling member dies others resume

** TODO [#B] Integration with transactions.
Do we want to replicate during transaction & replicate commit/rollback
or replicate only on commit?
No integration with DTX transactions.
** TODO [#B] Make new cluster work with replication exchange.
Possibly re-use some common logic. Replication exchange is like clustering
except over TCP.
** TODO [#B] Better concurrency, scalabiility on multi-cores.
Introduce PollableQueue of operations per broker queue. Queue up mcast
operations (enqueue, acquire, accept etc.) to be handled concurrently
on different queue. Performance testing to verify improved scalability.
** TODO [#C] Async completion for declare, bind, destroy queues and exchanges.
Cluster needs to complete these asynchronously to guarantee resources
exist across the cluster when the command completes.

** TODO [#C] Allow non-replicated exchanges, queues.

Set qpid.replicated=false in declare arguments, set flag on Exchange, Queue objects.
- save replicated status to store.
- support in management tools.
Replicated exchange: replicate binds to replicated queues.
Replicated queue: replicate all messages.

** TODO [#C] New members joining - improved.

Replicate wiring like old cluster, stall for wiring but not for
messages.  Update messages on a per-queue basis from back to front.

Updater:
- stall & push wiring: declare exchanges, queues, bindings.
- start update iterator thread on each queue.
- unstall and process normally while iterator threads run.

Update iterator thread:
- starts at back of updater queue, message m.
- send update_front(q,m) to updatee and advance towards front
- at front: send update_done(q)

Updatee:
- stall, receive wiring, lock all queues, mark queues "updating", unstall
- update_front(q,m): push m to *front* of q
- update_done(q): mark queue "ready"

Updatee cannot take the queue consume lock for a queue that is  updating.
Updatee *can* push messages onto a queue that is updating.

TODO: Is there any way to eliminate the stall for wiring?

** TODO [#C] Refactoring of common concerns.

There are a bunch of things that act as "Queue observers" with intercept
points in similar places.
- QueuePolicy
- QueuedEvents (async replication)
- MessageStore
- Cluster

Look for ways to capitalize on the similarity & simplify the code.

In particular QueuedEvents (async replication) strongly resembles
cluster replication, but over TCP rather than multicast.
** TODO [#C] Concurrency for enqueue events.
All enqueue events are being processed in the CPG deliver thread context which
serializes all the work. We only need ordering on a per queue basis, can we
enqueue in parallel on different queues and will that improve performance?
** TODO [#C] Handling immediate messages in a cluster
Include remote consumers in descision to deliver an immediate message?
