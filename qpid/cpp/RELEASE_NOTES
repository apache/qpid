Apache Qpid C++ M4 Release Notes
--------------------------------

The Qpid M4 release of the c++ client and broker support the 0-10
version of the AMQP specification.  You can access this specification
from: 

http://jira.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/Download

Notable additions for the M$ release includes, the c++ client API had improvements done to make it more user friendly. The c++ broker has a windows port, acl support, SSL support, performance enhancements and clustering (experimental).

Please note that due to c++ client API changes, it is likely that programs written against the M3 client will not compile.
You will need to change to the new API thats described at http://qpid.apache.org/docs/api/c++/html/index.html

For full details of Qpid c++ capabilities, as they currently stand,
