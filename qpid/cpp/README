= Developer guide to C++ codebase =

== Prerequisites ==

Apache Portable Runtime 1.2.7:  http://apr.apache.org/
Install in /usr/local/apr or update options.mk if installed elsewhere.

CppUnit: http://cppunit.sourceforge.net

Optional: to generate source code documentation you need:
 * doxygen: http://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/ 
 * graphviz - http://www.graphviz.org/

== Build and test ==

make

Default target builds and tests everything, see Makefile for other
targets.

=== Unit tests ===
Unit tests are built as .so files containing CppUnit plugins. 

DllPlugInTester is provided as part of cppunit. You can use it to run
any subset of the unit tests. See Makefile for examples.

=== System tests ===

The Python test suite ../python/run_tests is the main set of broker
system tests.

There are some C++ client test executables built under client/test.

== Doxygen ==

Doxygen generates documentation in several formats from source code
using special comments. You can use javadoc style comments if you know
javadoc, if you don't or want to know the fully story on doxygen
markup see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

Even even if the code is completely uncommented, doxygen generates
UML-esque dependency diagrams that are ''extremely'' useful in navigating
around the code, especially for newcomers.

To try it out "make doxygen" then open doxygen/html/index.html
