See DESIGN for design notes, Makefile comment for build system notes.

== Prerequisites ==

Required to build:
 * Apache Portable Runtime 1.2.7:  http://apr.apache.org
 * CppUnit 1.11.4: http://cppunit.sourceforge.net
 * boost 1.33.1: http://www.boost.org

Optional: to generate source code documentation you need:
 * doxygen 1.4.6: http://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/ 
 * graphviz 2.8: http://www.graphviz.org/

If you use yum to install packages:
# yum install apr apr-devel cppunit cppunit-devel boost boost-devel doxygen graphviz

== Build and test ==
For a debug build:
> make
For an optimized release build:
> make BUILD=RELEASE

The default target "test" builds everything and runs all tests. See
the Makefile for more targets.

=== Unit tests ===
Unit tests are built as .so files containing CppUnit plugins. 

DllPlugInTester is provided as part of cppunit. You can use it to run
any subset of the unit tests. See Makefile for examples.

NOTE: If foobar.so is a test plugin in the current directory then
surprisingly this will fail with "can't load plugin":
 DllPluginTester foobar.so

Instead you need to say:
 DllPluginTester ./foobar.so 
 
Reason: DllPluginTester uses dlopen() which searches for shlibs 
in the standard places unless the filename contains a "/".  In
that case it just tries to open the filename.

=== System tests ===

The Python test suite ../python/run_tests is the main set of broker
system tests.

There are some C++ client test executables built under client/test.

== Doxygen ==

Doxygen generates documentation in several formats from source code
using special comments. You can use javadoc style comments if you know
javadoc, if you don't or want to know the fully story on doxygen
markup see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

Even even if the code is completely uncommented, doxygen generates
UML-esque dependency diagrams that are ''extremely'' useful in navigating
around the code, especially for newcomers.

To try it out "make doxygen" then open doxygen/html/index.html
