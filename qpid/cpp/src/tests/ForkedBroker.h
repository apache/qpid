/**
 * Class to fork a broker child process.
 * 
 * For most tests a BrokerFixture may be more convenient as it starts
 * a broker in the same process which allows you to easily debug into
 * the broker.
 *
 * This useful for tests that need to start multiple brokers where
 * those brokers can't coexist in the same process (e.g. for cluster
 * tests where CPG doesn't allow multiple group members in a single
 * process.)
