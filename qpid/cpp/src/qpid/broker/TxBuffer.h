/**
 * Represents a single transaction. As such, an instance of this class
 * will hold a list of operations representing the workload of the
 * transaction. This work can be committed or rolled back. Committing
 * is a two-stage process: first all the operations should be
 * prepared, then if that succeeds they can be committed.
 * 
 * In the 2pc case, a successful prepare may be followed by either a
 * commit or a rollback.
 * 
 * Atomicity of prepare is ensured by using a lower level
 * transactional facility. This saves explicitly rolling back all the
 * successfully prepared ops when one of them fails. i.e. we do not
 * use 2pc internally, we instead ensure that prepare is atomic at a
 * lower level. This makes individual prepare operations easier to
 * code.
 * 
 * Transactions on a messaging broker effect three types of 'action':
 * (1) updates to persistent storage (2) updates to transient storage
 * or cached data (3) network writes.
 * 
 * Of these, (1) should always occur atomically during prepare to
 * ensure that if the broker crashes while a transaction is being
 * completed the persistent state (which is all that then remains) is
 * consistent. (3) can only be done on commit, after a successful
 * prepare. There is a little more flexibility with (2) but any
 * changes made during prepare should be subject to the control of the
 * TransactionalStore in use.
