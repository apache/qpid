  <!-- Type information:

Numeric types with "_wm" suffix are watermarked numbers.  These are compound
values containing a current value, and a low and high water mark for the reporting
interval.  The low and high water marks are set to the current value at the
beginning of each interval and track the minimum and maximum values of the statistic
over the interval respectively.

Access rights for configuration elements:

RO => Read Only
RC => Read/Create, can be set at create time only, read-only thereafter
RW => Read/Write

If access rights are omitted for a property, they are assumed to be RO.
