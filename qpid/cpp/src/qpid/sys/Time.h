/**
 * @class AbsTime
 *
 * Class to represent an instant in time.
 *
 * The time resolution is in nanosecs, and this is held with 64 bits
 * giving a total time span from about 25 million years ago to 25 million
 * years hence. As an aside the internal time can sensibly be negative
 * meaning before the epoch (probably 1/1/1970 although this class doesn't
 * care).
 *
 * The AbsTime class is a value class and so you don't need to add any
 * accessors to its internal state. If you think you want to replace its value,
 * you need to construct a new AbsTime and assign it, viz:
 *
 *  AbsTime when = AbsTime::now();
 *  ...
 *  when = AbsTime(when, 2*TIME_SEC); // Advance timer 2 secs
 *
 * If for some reason you need access to the internal nanosec value you need
 * to convert the AbsTime to a Duration and use its conversion to int64_t, viz:
 *
 *  AbsTime now = AbsTime::now();
 *
 *  int64_t ns = Duration(now);
 *
 * However note that the nanosecond value that is returned here is not
 * defined to be anything in particular and could vary from platform to
 * platform.
 *
 * There are some sensible operations that are currently missing from
 * AbsTime, but nearly all that's needed can be done with a mixture of
 * AbsTimes and Durations.
 *
 * For example, convenience operators to add a Duration and AbsTime returning
 * an AbsTime would fit here (although you can already perform the operation
 * with one of the AbsTime constructors). However trying to add 2 AbsTimes
 * doesn't make sense.
