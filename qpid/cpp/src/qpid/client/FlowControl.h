/**
 * Flow control works by associating a finite amount of "credit"
 * with a subscription.
 *
 * Credit includes a message count and a byte count. Each message
 * received decreases the message count by one, and the byte count by
 * the size of the message. Either count can have the special value
 * UNLIMITED which is never decreased.
 *
 * A subscription's credit is exhausted when the message count is 0 or
 * the byte count is too small for the next available message. The
 * subscription will not receive any further messages until is credit
 * is renewed.
 *
 * In "window mode" credit is automatically renewed when a message is
 * completed (which by default happens when it is accepted). In
 * non-window mode credit is not automatically renewed, it must be
 * explicitly re-set (@see Subscription)
