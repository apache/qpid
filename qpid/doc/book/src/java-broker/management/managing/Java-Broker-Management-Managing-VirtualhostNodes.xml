        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Priority</emphasis> (HA only). The priority of this node when elections
            occurs. The attribute can be used to make it more likely for a node to be elected than
            other nodes, or disallow the node from never being elected at all. See <xref

            Allows the number of nodes required to hold an election to be reduced in order that
            service can be restore when less than quorum nodes are present. See <xref

          <para><emphasis>Stop</emphasis>. Stops the virtualhost node. This closes any existing
            messaging connections to the virtualhost and prevents new ones. Any inflight
            transactions are rolled back. Non durable queues and exchanges are lost. Transient
            messages or persistent messages on non-durable queues are lost.</para>
          <para>When HA is in use, stopping the virtualhost node stops the virtualhost node from
            participating in the group. If the node was in the master role, the remaining nodes will
            try to conduct an election and elect a new master. If the node was in the replica role,
            the node will cease to keep up to date with later transactions. A stopped node does not
            vote in elections. Other nodes in the group will report the stopped node as
            unreachable.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Start</emphasis>. Activates the virtualhost node.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Delete</emphasis>. Deletes the virtualhost node and the virtualhost
            contained within it. All exchanges and queues, any the messages contained within it are
            removed. In the HA case, deleting the virtualhost node causes it be removed
            permanently from the group.</para>
