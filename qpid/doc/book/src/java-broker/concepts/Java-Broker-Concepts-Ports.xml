    <para> The Broker supports configuration of <emphasis>Ports</emphasis> to specify the particular
        AMQP messaging and HTTP/JMX management connectivity it offers for use. </para>
    <para> Each Port is configured with the particular <emphasis>Protocols</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>Transports</emphasis> it supports, as well as the <emphasis>Authentication
            Provider</emphasis> to be used to authenticate connections. Where SSL is in use, the
            <emphasis>Port</emphasis> configuration also defines which <emphasis>Keystore</emphasis>
        to use and (where supported) which <emphasis>TrustStore(s)</emphasis> and whether Client
        Certificates should be requested/required. </para>
    <para> Different <emphasis>Ports</emphasis> can support different protocols, and many
            <emphasis>Ports</emphasis> can be configured on the Broker.</para>
    <para> The following AMQP protocols are currently supported by the Broker: <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>AMQP 0-8</emphasis></para></listitem>

    </para>

    <para> Additionally, HTTP and JMX ports can be configured for use by the associated management
        plugins. </para>
    <para>This diagram explains how Ports, <link

        and an Access Control Provider work together to allow an application to form a connection to
        a Virtualhost.<figure>
