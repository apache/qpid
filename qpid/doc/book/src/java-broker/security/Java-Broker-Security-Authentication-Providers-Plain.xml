<section id="Java-Broker-Security-Plain-Provider">
    <title>Plain</title>
    <para>The Plain Provider uses the Broker configuration itself to store the database of users
        (unlike the <link linkend="Java-Broker-Security-PlainPasswordFile-Provider"
            >PlainPasswordFile</link>, there is no separate password file). As the name suggests,
        the user data (including password) is not hashed in any way. In order to provide encryption,
        the facilities described in <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Security-Configuration-Encryption"/>
        must be used.</para>
    <para>For this provider user credentials can be added, removed or changed using
        Management.</para>
