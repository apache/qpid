<section id="Java-Broker-Security-MD5-Provider">
    <title>MD5 Provider</title>

    <para> MD5 Provider  uses the Broker configuration itself to store the database of
        users (unlike the <link linkend="Java-Broker-Security-Base64MD5PasswordFile-Provider"
            >Base64MD5 Password File</link>, there is no separate password file). Rather than store the
        unencrypted user password (as the Plain provider does) it instead stores the MD5 password
        digest.  This can be further encrypted using the
        facilities described in <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Security-Configuration-Encryption"
        />.</para>
    <para>For this provider user credentials can be added, removed or changed using
        Management.</para>
