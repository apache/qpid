    <title>Authentication Providers</title>
    <para>
        <emphasis>Authentication Providers</emphasis> are used to authenticate connections to <emphasis>Ports</emphasis>.
        Many <emphasis>Authentication Providers</emphasis> can be configured on the Broker at the same time, from which
        each <emphasis>Port</emphasis> can be assigned one.
    </para>
    <para>
        The following authentication providers are supported:
        <itemizedlist>

            allows anonymous connections to the broker</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><link linkend= "Java-Broker-Security-External-Provider">External</link>:

            authenticate users against credentials stored in plain text in a local file.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><link linkend= "Java-Broker-Security-Base64MD5PasswordFile-Provider">Base64MD5PasswordFile</link>:
            authenticate users against credentials stored encoded in a local file.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
        The Password File based providers can perform explicit management (adding, removing, changing passwords)
        of users via the Brokers management interfaces. The other providers offer no ability to manage users as they either have no scope
        for user management (e.g Anonymous) or delegate this task to other systems (e.g LDAP).
