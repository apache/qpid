      Configuring ACLs
  </title>
  <para>
    In Qpid, ACLs specify which actions can be performed by each authenticated user. To enable the ACL &lt;acl/&gt; element is used within the 
    &lt;security/&gt; element of the configuration XML. In the Java Broker, the ACL may be imposed broker wide or applied to individual virtual
    hosts.  The  &lt;acl/&gt; references a text file containing the ACL rules.  By convention, this file should have a .acl extension.

       Enabling ACLs

    <para>
      To apply an ACL broker-wide, add the following to the config.xml (Assuming that <replaceable>conf</replaceable> has been set to a suitable
      location such as ${QPID_HOME}/etc)
    </para>
 
    <programlisting>
      &lt;broker&gt;

      &lt;/broker&gt;
    </programlisting>

    <para>
      To apply an ACL on a single virtualhost named <replaceable>test</replaceable>, add the following to the config.xml:
    </para>
 
    <programlisting>
      &lt;virtualhost&gt;
        ...
        &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;

    <title>
       Writing .acl files
    </title>

    <para>
      The ACL file consists of a series of rules and group definitions.  Each rule grants or denies specific rights to a user or group. Group
      definitions declare groups of users and serve to make the ACL file more concise.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each ACL rule grants (or denies) a particular action on a object to a user.  The rule may be augmented with one or more properties, restricting
      the rule's applicability.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ACL ALLOW alice CREATE QUEUE              # Grants alice permission to create all queues.
      ACL DENY bob CREATE QUEUE name="myqueue"  # Denies bob permission to create a queue called "myqueue"
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      The ACL is considered in strict line order with the first matching rule taking precedence over all those that follow. In the following
      example, if the user bob tries to create an exchange "myexch", the operation will be allowed by the first rule.  The second rule will
      never be considered.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ACL ALLOW bob ALL EXCHANGE
      ACL DENY bob CREATE EXCHANGE name="myexch"  # Dead rule
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      If the desire is to allow bob to create all exchanges except "myexch", order of the rules must be reversed:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ACL DENY bob CREATE EXCHANGE name="myexch" 
      ACL ALLOW bob ALL EXCHANGE
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      All ACL files end with a implict rule denying all operations to all users.  It is as if each file ends with 
      <programlisting>ACL DENY ALL ALL </programlisting>
      To allow all operations, other than those controlled by earlier use <programlisting>ACL ALLOW ALL ALL </programlisting> instead.
    </para>
    <para>
      When writing a new ACL, a good approach is to begin with an .acl file containing only <programlisting>ACL DENY-LOG ALL ALL</programlisting>
      which will cause the Broker to deny all operations with details of the denial logged to the Qpid log file. Build up the ACL rule by rule,
      gradually working through the use-cases of your system.  Once the ACL is complete, switch the DEBY-LOG to DENY for optimum performamce.
    </para>
    <para>
      ACL rules are very powerful: it is possible to write very expressive rules permissioning every AMQP objects enumerating all object
      properties.  Most projects probably won't need this degree of flexibility.  A reasonable approach is to choose to apply permissions
      at a certain level of abstraction (i.e. QUEUE) and apply consistently across the whole system.

       Syntax
    </title>

    <para>
       ACL rules must follow this syntax:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
     ACL {permission} {&lt;group-name&gt;|&lt;user-name>&gt;|ALL} {action|ALL} [object|ALL] [property="&lt;property-value&gt;"]

    <para>
       GROUP definitions must follow this syntax:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
     GROUP {group name} {username 1}..{username n} # Where username is a username, or a groupname.
    </programlisting>

    <para>
       Comments may be introduced with the hash (#) character and are ignored.  Long lines can be broken with the slash (\) character.
