  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Apache Qpid&#8482; is a cross-platform Enterprise
    Messaging system which implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    (AMQP), providing message brokers written in C++ and
    Java, along with clients for C++, Java JMS, .Net, Python, and Ruby.</p>

  <p>Enterprise Messaging systems let programs communicate by
    exchanging messages, much as people communicate by
    exchanging email. Unlike email, enterprise messaging systems
    provide guaranteed delivery, speed, security, and freedom
    from spam. Until recently, there was no open standard for
    Enterprise Messaging systems, so programmers either wrote
    their own, or used expensive proprietary systems.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.amqp.org/">AMQP</a> is the first open standard for
    Enterprise Messaging. It is designed to support messaging
    for just about any distributed or business
    application. Routing can be configured flexibly, easily
    supporting common messaging paradigms like point-to-point,
    fanout, publish-subscribe, and request-response.</p>

  <p>Apache Qpid implements the latest AMQP specification, providing
    transaction management, queuing, distribution, security,
    management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous
    multi-platform support and a lot more. And Apache Qpid is
    extremely fast. Apache Qpid <a href="compatibility.html"
    title="AMQP compatibility">aims to be 100% AMQP Compliant</a>.</p>

  <p>This is a project of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation.</a></p>
