/**
 * QPID-1385 : Race condition between added to unacked map and resending due to a rollback.
 *
 * In AMQChannel _unackedMap.clear() was done after the visit. This meant that the clear was not in the same
 * synchronized block as as the preparation to resend.
 *
 * This clearing/prep for resend was done as a result of the rollback call. HOWEVER, the delivery thread was still
 * in the process of sending messages to the client. It is therefore possible that a message could block on the
 * _unackedMap lock waiting for the visit to compelete so that it can add the new message to the unackedMap....
 * which is then cleared by the resend/rollback thread.
 *
 * This problem was encountered by the testSend2ThenRollback test.
 *
 * To try and increase the chance of the race condition occuring this test will send multiple messages so that the
 * delivery thread will be in progress while the rollback method is called. Hopefully this will cause the
 * deliveryTag to be lost
