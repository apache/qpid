Temporary local repository for jars that are not available in the central repository yet.
This was created because junit-toolkit is undergoing some development to use it with perf tests. Its an Apache licensed performance testing utility.
It takes 2-4 days to get something added to the central repo but want to keep up with changed to junit-toolkit. This repository holds a snapshot
of it, so that the build can get it from somewhere without breaking. It is anticipated that it will reach a stable 0.5 version within two weeks from
30/01/2007, at which time it will be placed in the central repo and this local repository will be deleted.
