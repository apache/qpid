In addition to the integration tests the framework provided by this package also allows for
sustained tests to be run. Currently avaible tests:
- org.apache.qpid.sustained.SustainedClientTestCase : Pub Sub test to determine steady state throughput.


Running Tests.

Run the tests as per the integration tests.
- Start a broker
- Start at least one test client [java org.apache.qpid.interop.TestClient], ensuring unique naming.

- Start the test coordinator with the 'fanout' engine, on the sustained test case [java org.apache.qpid.test.framework.distributedtesting.Coordinator]

- Additional Test clients can be started and joined into the running test:  [java org.apache.qpid.interop.TestClient -j]
