In order to use the runSample script, you are required to set two environment
variables, QPID_HOME and QPID_SAMPLE. If not the default values will be used.

QPID_HOME
---------
This is the distribution directory. You would have set the QPID_HOME when you
started the Qpid Java broker.

default: /usr/share/java/

QPID_SAMPLE
-----------
This is the parent directory of the directory in which you find the runSample.sh
(Ex:- $QPID_SRC_HOME/java/client/example/src/main)

default: /usr/share/doc/rhm-0.2
