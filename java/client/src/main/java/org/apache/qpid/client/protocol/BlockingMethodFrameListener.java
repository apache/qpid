/**
 * BlockingMethodFrameListener is a 'rendezvous' which acts as a {@link AMQMethodListener} that delegates handling of
 * incoming methods to a method listener implemented as a sub-class of this and hands off the processed method or
 * error to a consumer. The producer of the event does not have to wait for the consumer to take the event, so this
 * differs from a 'rendezvous' in that sense.
 *
 * <p/>BlockingMethodFrameListeners are used to coordinate waiting for replies to method calls that expect a response.
 * They are always used in a 'one-shot' manner, that is, to recieve just one response. Usually the caller has to register
 * them as method listeners with an event dispatcher and remember to de-register them (in a finally block) once they
 * have been completed.
 *
 * <p/>The {@link #processMethod} must return <tt>true</tt> on any incoming method that it handles. This indicates to
 * this listeners that the method it is waiting for has arrived. Incoming methods are also filtered by channel prior to
 * being passed to the {@link #processMethod} method, so responses are only received for a particular channel. The
 * channel id must be passed to the constructor.
 *
 * <p/>Errors from the producer are rethrown to the consumer.
 *
 * <p/><table id="crc"><caption>CRC Card</caption>
 * <tr><th> Responsibilities <th> Collaborations
 * <tr><td> Accept notification of AMQP method events. <td> {@link AMQMethodEvent}
 * <tr><td> Delegate handling of the method to another method listener. <td> {@link AMQMethodBody}
 * <tr><td> Block until a method is handled by the delegated to handler.
 * <tr><td> Propagate the most recent exception to the consumer.
 * </table>
 *
 * @todo Might be neater if this method listener simply wrapped another that provided the method handling using a
 *       methodRecevied method. The processMethod takes an additional channelId, however none of the implementations
 *       seem to use it. So wrapping the listeners is possible.
 *
 * @todo What is to stop a blocking method listener, receiving a second method whilst it is registered as a listener,
 *       overwriting the first one before the caller of the block method has had a chance to examine it? If one-shot
 *       behaviour is to be intended it should be enforced, perhaps by always returning false once the blocked for
 *       method has been received.
 *
 * @todo Interuption is caught but not handled. This could be allowed to fall through. This might actually be usefull
 *       for fail-over where a thread is blocking when failure happens, it could be interrupted to abandon or retry
 *       when this happens. At the very least, restore the interrupted status flag.
 *
 * @todo If the retrotranslator can handle it, could use a SynchronousQueue to implement this rendezvous. Need to
 *       check that SynchronousQueue has a non-blocking put method available.
