Building the examples
---------------------

You had better edit the Makefile and provide the locations for APR and boost.

Then just type 'make'.


Running the examples
--------------------

Before running the examples ensure that you have setup your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Most of the examples take the following connection parameters for your 
AMQP broker:

    -host host
    -port port
