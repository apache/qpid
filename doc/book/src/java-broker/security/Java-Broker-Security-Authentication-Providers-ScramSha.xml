<section id="Java-Broker-Security-ScramSha-Providers">
    <title>SCRAM SHA</title>
    <para>The SCRAM SHA Providers uses the Broker configuration itself to store the database of
        users. The users'
        passwords are stored as salted SHA digested password. This can be further encrypted using the
        facilities described in <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Security-Configuration-Encryption"
        />.</para>
    <para>There are two variants of this provider, SHA1 and SHA256. SHA256 is recommended whenever
        possible. SHA1 is provided with compatibility with clients utilising JDK 1.6 (which does not
        support SHA256).</para>
    <para>For these providers user credentials can be added, removed or changed using
        Management.</para>
