<section id="Java-Broker-Security-Configuration-Encryption">
  <title>Configuration Encryption</title>
  <para> The Broker is capable of encrypting passwords and other security items stored in the
    Broker's configuration. This is means that items such as keystore/truststore passwords, JDBC
    passwords, and LDAP passwords can be stored in the configure in a form that is difficult to
    read.</para>
  <para>The Broker ships with an encryptor implementation called <literal>AESKeyFile</literal>. This
    uses a securely generated random key of 256bit<footnote><para>Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
        Unlimited Strength required</para></footnote> to encrypt the secrets stored within a key
    file. Of course, the key itself must be guarded carefully, otherwise the passwords encrypted
    with it may be compromised. For this reason, the Broker that the file's permissions allow the
    file to be read exclusively by the user account used for running the Broker.</para>
  <important>
    <para>If the keyfile is lost or corrupted, the secrets will be irrecoverable.</para>
  </important>
  <section id="Java-Broker-Security-Configuration-Encryption-Configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>To use <literal>AESKeyFile</literal>, first stop the Broker, then edit the Broker's
      configuration file ${QPID_WORK}/config.json. Insert a Broker attribute called
        <literal>confidentialConfigurationEncryptionProvider</literal> with value
        <literal>AESKeyFile</literal>. On restarting the Broker, it will generate a keyfile in
      location <literal>${QPID_WORK}/.keys/</literal>. Any existing passwords contained with the
      configuration will be automatically encrypted, as will any new or changed ones in
      future.</para>
    <example>
      <title>Enanbling password encryption</title>
      <screen>
 {
  "id" : "3f183a59-abc3-40ad-8e14-0cac9de2cac4",
  "name" : "${broker.name}",
  "confidentialConfigurationEncryptionProvider" : "AESKeyFile",
  ....
 }
      </screen>
    </example>
    <para>Note that passwords stored by the Authentication Providers <link
        linkEnd="Java-Broker-Security-PlainPasswordFile-Provider">PlainPasswordFile</link> and.
        <link linkEnd="Java-Broker-Security-Base64MD5PasswordFile-Provider">PlainPasswordFile</link>
      with the external password files are <emphasis>not</emphasis> encrypted by the key. Use the
      Scram Authentication Managers instead; these make use of the Configuration Encryption when
      storing the users' passwords. </para>
  </section>
  <section id="Java-Broker-Security-Configuration-Encryption-Alternate-Implementations">
    <title>Alternate Implementations</title>
    <para>If the <literal>AESKeyFile</literal> encryptor implementation does not meet the needs of
      the user, perhaps owing to the security standards of their institution, the
        <literal>ConfigurationSecretEncrypter</literal> interface is designed as an extension point.
      Users may implement their own implementation of ConfigurationSecretEncrypter perhaps to employ
      stronger encryption or delegating the storage of the key to an Enterprise Password Safe.</para>
