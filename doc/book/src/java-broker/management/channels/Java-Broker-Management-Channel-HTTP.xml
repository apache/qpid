        <para>The HTTP Management plugin provides a HTTP based API for monitoring and control of the
            Broker. The plugin actually provides two interfaces:</para>

                            Console</link> - rich web based interface for the management of the
                        Broker.</para>

                        REST API providing complete programmatic management of the Broker.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>The Web Management Console itself uses the REST API, so every function you can perform
            through the Web Management Console can be also be scripted and integrated into other
            systems. This provides a simple integration point allowing the Broker to monitored and
            controlled from systems such as Naoios or BMC Control-M.</para>

        <title>Default Configuration</title>
        <para>By default, the Broker is shipped with HTTP enabled running port 8080. The HTTP plugin
            is configured to require SASL authentication. The port is not SSL protected.</para>
        <!-- TODO describe what to do if the port conflicts -->
        <para>The settings can be changed by configuring the HTTP plugin and/or the port configured
            to serve HTTP.</para>
