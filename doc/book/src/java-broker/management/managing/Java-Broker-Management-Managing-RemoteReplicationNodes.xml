<section id="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-RemoteReplicationNodes">
  <title>Remote Replication Nodes</title>
  <para>Used for HA only. A <link linkend="Java-Broker-Concepts-RemoteReplicationNodes">remote replication node</link> is a representation of another virtualhost node
    in the group. Remote replication nodes are not created directly. Instead the system
    automatically creates a remote replication node for every node in the group. It serves to
    provide a view of the whole group from every node in the system.</para>
