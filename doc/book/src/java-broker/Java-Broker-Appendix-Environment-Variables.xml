  <title>Environment Variables</title>
  <para>The following table describes the environment variables understood by the Qpid scripts
    contained within the <literal>/bin</literal> directory within the Broker distribution.</para>
  <para>To take effect, these variables must be set within the shell (and exported - if using Unix)
    before invoking the script.</para>

            <para>The variable used to tell the Broker its installation directory. It must be an
              absolute path. This is used to determine the location of Qpid's dependency JARs and
              some configuration files.</para>
            <para>Typically the value of this variable will look similar to
                <literal>c:\qpid\&windowsExtractedBrokerDirName;</literal> (Windows) or
                <literal>/usr/local/qpid/&unixExtractedBrokerDirName;</literal> (Unix). The
              installation prefix will differ from installation to installation. </para>
            <para>If not set, a value for <literal>QPID_HOME</literal> is derived from the location
              of the script itself.</para>

            <para>This is the preferred mechanism for customising the size of the JVM's heap memory.
              The value should contain valid memory option(s) for the target JVM. Oracle JVMs
              understand <literal>-Xmx</literal> to specify a maximum heap size and
                <literal>-Xms</literal> an initial size.</para>
            <para>For example, <code>QPID_JAVA_MEM=-Xmx6g</code> would set a maximum heap size of
              6GB.</para>

            <para>This is the preferred mechanism for passing any other JVM options. This variable is
