            Asynchronous
            Replication of Queue State
          </title>
  <para>
            There is support in qpidd for selective asynchronous replication
            of queue state. This is achieved by:
          </para>
  <para>
            (a) enabling event generation for the queues in question
          </para>
  <para>
            (b) loading a plugin on the 'source' broker to encode those
            events as messages on a replication queue (this plugin is
            called
            replicating_listener.so)
          </para>
  <para>
            (c) loading a custom exchange plugin on the 'backup' broker (this
            plugin is called replication_exchange.so)
          </para>
  <para>
            (d) creating an instance of the replication exchange type on the
            backup broker
          </para>
  <para>
            (e) establishing a federation bridge between the replication
            queue on the source broker and the replication exchange on the
            backup broker
          </para>
  <para>
            The bridge established between the source and backup brokers for
            replication (step (e) above) should have acknowledgements turned
            on (this may be done through the --ack N option to qpid-route).
            This ensures that replication events are not lost if the bridge
            fails.
          </para>
  <para>
            The replication protocol will also eliminate duplicates to ensure
            reliably replicated state. Note though that only one bridge per
            replication exchange is supported. If clients try to publish to
            the replication exchange or if more than a the single required
            bridge from the replication queue on the source broker is
            created, replication will be corrupted. (Access control may be
            used to restrict access and help prevent this).
          </para>
  <para>
            The replicating event listener plugin (step (b) above) has the
            following options:
          </para>
  <para>
            The name of the queue is required. It can either point to a
            durable queue whose definition has been previously recorded, or
            the --create-replication-queue option can be specified in which
            case the queue will be created a simple non-durable queue if it
            does not already exist.
          </para>

            Clustering
          </bridgehead>
  <para>
            The source and/or backup brokers may also be clustered brokers.
            In this case the federated bridge will be re-established between
            replicas should either of the originally connected nodes fail.
            There are however the following limitations at present:

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>The backup site does not process membership updates after it
            establishes the first connection. In order for newly added
            members on a source cluster to be eligible as failover targets,
            the bridge must be recreated after those members have been added
            to the source cluster.

  </itemizedlist>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>New members added to a backup cluster will not receive
            information about currently established bridges. Therefore in
            order to allow the bridge to be re-established from these members
            in the event of failure of older nodes, the bridge must be
            recreated after the new members have joined.

      <para>Only a single URL can be passed to create the initial link
            from backup site to the primary site. this means that at the time
            of creating the initial connection the initial node in the
            primary site to which the connection is made needs to be running.
            Once connected the backup site will receive a membership update
            of all the nodes in the primary site, and if the initial
            connection node in the primary fails, the link will be
            re-established on the next node that was started (time) on the
            primary site.

    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
            Due to the acknowledged transfer of events over the bridge (see
            note above) manual recreation of the bridge and automatic
            re-establishment of te bridge after connection failure (including
            failover where either or both ends are clustered brokers) will
            not result in event loss.

  <para>
            When replicating the state of a queue to a backup broker it is
            important to recognise that any other operations performed
            directly on the backup queue may break the replication.
          </para>
  <para>
            If the backup queue is to be an active (i.e. accessed by clients
            while replication is on) only enqueues should be selected
            for
            replication. In this mode, any message enqueued on the source
            brokers copy of the queue will also be enqueued on the backup
            brokers copy. However not attempt will be made to remove messages
            from the backup queue in response to removal of messages from the
            source queue.

            Queues for Replication
          </bridgehead>
  <para>
            Queues are selected for replication by specifying the types of
            events they should generate (it is from these events that the
            replicating plugin constructs messages which are then pulled and
            processed by the backup site). This is done through options
            passed to the initial queue-declare command that creates the
            queue and may be done either through qpid-config or similar
            tools, or by the application.
          </para>
  <para>
            With qpid-config, the --generate-queue-events options is used:
          </para>
  <para>
            From an application, the arguments field of the queue-declare
            AMQP command is used to convey this information. An entry should
            be added to the map with key 'qpid.queue_event_generation' and an
            integer value of 1 (to replicate only enqueue events) or 2 (to
            replicate both enqueue and dequeue events).
          </para>
  <para>
            Applications written using the c++ client API may fine the
            qpid::client::QueueOptions class convenient. This has a
            enableQueueEvents() method on it that can be used to set the
            option (the instance of QueueOptions is then passed as the value
            of the arguments field in the queue-declare command. The boolean
            option to that method should be set to true if only enequeue
            events should be replicated; by default it is false meaning that
            both enqueues and dequeues will be replicated. E.g.

  <bridgehead id="queuestatereplication-Example"><anchor id="queuestatereplication-Example"/>Example
          </bridgehead>
  <para>
            Lets assume we will run the primary broker on host1 and the
            backup on host2, have installed qpidd on both and have the
            replicating_listener and replication_exchange plugins in qpidd's
            module directory(*1).
          </para>
  <para>
            On host1 we start the source broker and specifcy that a queue
            called 'replication' should be used for storing the events until
            consumed by the backup. We also request that this queue be
            created (as transient) if not already specified:
          </para>
  <para>
            On host2 we start up the backup broker ensuring that the
            replication exchange module is loaded:
          </para>
  <para>
            We can then create the instance of that replication exchange that
            we will use to process the events:
          </para>
  <para>
            If this fails with the message "Exchange type not implemented:
            replication", it means the replication exchange module was
            not
            loaded. Check that the module is installed on your system and if
            necessary provide the full path to the library.
          </para>
  <para>
            We then connect the replication queue on the source broker with
            the replication exchange on the backup broker using the
            qpid-route command:
          </para>
  <para>
            The example above configures the bridge to acknowledge messages
            in batches of 50.
          </para>
  <para>
            Now create two queues (on both source and backup brokers), one
            replicating both enqueues and dequeues (queue-a) and the
            other
            replicating only dequeues (queue-b):
          </para>
  <para>
            We are now ready to use the queues and see the replication.
          </para>
  <para>
            Any message enqueued on queue-a will be replicated to the backup
            broker. When the message is acknowledged by a client connected to
            host1 (and thus dequeued), that message will be removed from the
            copy of the queue on host2. The state of queue-a on host2 will
            thus mirror that of the equivalent queue on host1, albeit with a
            small lag. (Note
            however that we must not have clients connected to host2 publish
            to-or consume from- queue-a or the state will fail to replicate
            correctly due to conflicts).
          </para>
  <para>
            Any message enqueued on queue-b on host1 will also be enqueued on
            the equivalent queue on host2. However the acknowledgement and
            consequent dequeuing of messages from queue-b on host1 will have
            no effect on the state of queue-b on host2.
          </para>
  <para>
            (*1) If not the paths in the above may need to be modified. E.g.
            if using modules built from a qpid svn checkout, the following
            would be added to the command line used to start qpidd on host1:
          </para>
  <para>
            and the following for the equivalent command line on host2:
          </para>
