This module loads protocol metadata into python objects. It provides
access to spec metadata via a python object model, and can also
dynamically creating python methods, classes, and modules based on the
spec metadata. All the generated methods have proper signatures and
doc strings based on the spec metadata so the python help system can
be used to browse the spec documentation. The generated methods all
dispatch to the self.invoke(meth, args) callback of the containing
class so that the generated code can be reused in a variety of
situations.
