        # Now we can send regular commands. If you want to see what the method
        # arguments mean or what other commands are available, you can use the

        # interact with the server.

        # All the protocol methods return a message object. The message object
        # has fields corresponding to the reply method fields, plus a content
        # field that is filled if the reply includes content. In this case the
        # interesting field is the consumer_tag.
