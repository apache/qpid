/**
 * This is a test address QPID-1431 where frame listeners would fail to be notified of an incomming exception.
 *
 * Currently we do checks at the Session level to ensure that the connection/session are open. However, it is possible
 * for the connection to close AFTER this check has been performed.
 *
 * Performing a similar check at the frameListener level in AMQProtocolHandler makes most sence as this will prevent
 * listening when there can be no returning frames.
 *
 * With the correction in place it also means that the new listener will either make it on to the list for notification
 * or it will be notified of any existing exception due to the connection being closed.
 *
 * There may still be an issue in this space if the client utilises a second thread to close the session as there will
 * be no exception set to throw and so the wait will occur. That said when the session is closed the framelisteners
 * should be notified. Not sure this is tested.

     * What occurs is that we create a new thread that will block (<30s[DEFAULT]) for a frame or exception to occur .
     *
     * We use a CountDownLatch to ensure that the new thread is running before we then yield and sleep to help ensure
     * the new thread has entered the synchronized block in the writeCommandFrameAndWaitForReply.
     *
     * We can then ack like an the incomming exception handler in (ConnectionCloseMethodHandler).
     *
     * We fire the error to the stateManager, which in this case will recored the error as there are no state listeners.
     *
     * We then set the connection to be closed, as we would normally close the socket at this point.
     *
     * Then fire the exception in to any frameListeners.
     *
     * The blocked listener (created above) when receiving the error simulates the user by creating a new request to
     * block for a frame.
     *
     * This request should fail. Prior to the fix this will fail with a NPE as we are attempting to use a null listener
     * in the writeCommand.... call L:268.
     *
     * This highlights that the listener would be added dispite there being a pending error state that the listener will
     * miss as it is not currently part of the _frameListeners set that is being notified by the iterator.
     *
     * The method waits to ensure that an exception is received before returning.
     *
     * The calling methods validate that exception that was received based on the one they sent in.
