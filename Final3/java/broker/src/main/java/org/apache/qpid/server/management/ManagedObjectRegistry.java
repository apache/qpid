/**
 * Handles the registration (and unregistration and so on) of managed objects.
 *
 * Managed objects are responsible for exposting attributes, operations and notifications. They will expose
 * these outside the JVM therefore it is important not to use implementation objects directly as managed objects.
 * Instead, creating inner classes and exposing those is an effective way of exposing internal state in a
 * controlled way.
 *
 * Although we do not explictly use them while targetting Java 5, the enhanced MXBean approach in Java 6 will
 * be the obvious choice for managed objects.
