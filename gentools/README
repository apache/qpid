AMQP MULTI_VERSION CODE GENERATOR

This directory contains the first part of the new multi-AMQP-version code
generator. The Java generation is almost complete, C++ will follow.

NOTE: The generator has NOT been integrated into the current build, and is
included here to run stand-alone for the purposes of review and comment. As
currently configured, this generator will not interact with any file or
directory outside of this directory.

To build (from this directory):
javac  org/apache/qpid/gentools/Main.java

Make sure you are using Sun's JDK1.5.0; Eclipse and gcj do not work.

To run (from this directory):
java org/apache/qpid/gentools/Main -j [xml_spec_file, ...]

XML test files are located in the xml-src directory. Pay attention to the
Basic class and Basic.Consume method - these were the primary test vehicles
for this generator. *** NOTE *** These files do not represent any current or
future version of the AMQP specification - do not use in production!

Folders:
--------
org/apache/qpid/gentools/: Source.
xml-src/: Test AMQP specification files.
templ.java/: Templates for java code generation.
out.java/: Output folder for generated Java files (will be created with use
           of -j flag on command-line).
templ.cpp/: (Future:) Templates for C++ code generation.
out.cpp/: Output folder for generated C++ files (will be created with use
           of -c flag on command-line).

For a more detaild description of the generator, see the Qpid Wiki
(http://cwiki.apache.org/qpid/multiple-amqp-version-support.html).

Please send comments and bugs to me (kim.vdriet [at] redhat.com) or via the
Apache Qpid list (qpid-dev [at] incubator.apache.org).
